<p>ISU AMS Meeting Minutes<br>
http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/<br>
March 01, 2004</p>

A slide show was presented from the WISE (Women In
Science and Engineering) presentation that took place
in 3128 last Thursday, February 26th.  Janet, Elise,
Heather, and Jesse talked to a group of school girls
about severe weather, tornadoes, lightning, and
meteorology in general.  The children also built their
own tornado-in-a-bottles.<br><br>

John Baranek and Jon Hobbs participated last week in a
school talk with St. Augustin children.  They
discussed hurricanes.<br><br>

Andy Kula of the Des Moines National Weather Service
would like to thank everyone who participated in the
Spotter Training Review session.  There were 89 total
participants, many of whom were Iowa State students.<br><br>

Several students at Iowa State expressed interest in
getting an internship at the Des Moines NWS.  An
e-mail was sent to AMS giving information on
internship opportunities there.  If you are interested
in volunteering at the National Weather Service
contact Karl Jungbluth at 515-270-4501 or go to the
following website: <br>
http://ohrm.doc.gov/handbooks/studnet_empl/general_info.htm<br><br>

Also, Brenda Brock, Meteorologist In Charge at the Des
Moines NWS offered the advice that relocation to other
parts of the country is often a good way to get a job
at the National Weather Service.  She offered the
following website as a place for further information:
http://www.opm.gov .<br><br>

Jeremy discussed the current forecasting contests AMS
students are participating in.   Atlanta, GA is
currently the forecast site for the National
Collegiate Weather Forecasting Contest, with
Flagstaff, AZ coming up next week into Spring Break
week.  If you do not want to forecast over Spring
Break
or Flagstaff for other reasons, make sure you contact
Jeremy (<script language="JavaScript"><!--
