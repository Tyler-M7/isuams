AMS Dues need to be paid in order to be a member,
participate in social activities, and to vote.  They
MUST be paid by the 2nd meeting of the year, and were

Adam (ajkuban@iastate.edu) in the form of cash or

Jeremy will be in charge of the National Collegiate
Weather Forecasting Contest this year, with Janet
helping.  The contest consists of 1000 or so
participants (undergrads, grad students, and
professors) from 38 institutions.  It consists of
forecasting 4 days a week in 2 week blocks for 13
cities around the nation.  You only need to
participate in 8 of the 13 periods to be eligible for
the annual prize.  The cost for entering the contest
is $4, which can be paid to Adam.  If you want to
write one check for both AMS and NCWFC dues, that's
fine.  There will be a meeting on Tuesday, September
9, at 7pm in 3128 Agronomy to discuss the rules and
techniques of the contest, as well as insight on how
to better your forecast.  A sign-up sheet was passed
out at the meeting for those interested, but if you
didn't get a chance to sign, contact Jeremy at
jgrams@iastate.edu to do so.  There will also be a
local AMS forecasting contest and an ISU contest, with
Dr. Gallus helping.  This contest will consist of a
more rigorous 4 days a week all year forecasting for
Des Moines.  For more information on that, come to the
NCWFC meeting Tuesday.<br><br>
