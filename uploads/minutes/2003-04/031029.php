as a free gift will be covered in the $75 dollar fee.

around for those interested in attending.  Contact
Kevin to get your name on this list.  For more

Roll for the 3rd consecutive year.  This award is
given by the National American Meteorological Society.<BR><BR>

There are still a few AMS/ISU Meteorology t-shirts and
sweatshirts available in select sizes from last year.
New ones will be ordered/designed if there is enough
interest, as well as polo shirts.  The t-shirts and
sweatshirts are either grey/red or navy/gold.  The
polo shirts last year had a Cyclone/AMS logo on them
and were available in blue or red.  Contact Jon if you
have design/logo ideas or if you are interested in
getting a t-shirt (either last year's or this year's).
