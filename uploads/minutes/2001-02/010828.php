He will be posting a calender of events of meetings and
the minutes of each meeting soon. AOL Instant Messenger
names and email addresses of all members will be posted soon. Check
it out.</P>

<P>There will be no Storm Chase Club this year. Instead those interested in storm chasing will receive emails from those who will want to
storm chase. The hot spot for decision-making will be the
map room (Agronomy 3008), where students will meet and
decide who's going to drive and who needs rides. However,
storm chasing will not be an official activity of the ISU
AMS.</P>
<P>Ideas for a spring break trip include visiting the Weather Channel in Atlanta
and a lightning center in Florida and then spending the rest of the time
in Florida. Other ideas include NCAR in Boulder, Colorado, and Chicago.
