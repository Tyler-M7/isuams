<p>ISU AMS Meeting Minutes<br>
http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/<br>
September 29, 2009</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Start Time: 
7:07pm</font> <br> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>President Hatteberg</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Rachel began the meeting with an update 
on Storm the Dorms. We have been in contact with David Bunker (our contact 
in the ISU Department of Residence for this project) and are waiting 
for him get the signs. As a reminder, Storm the Dorms consists of us 
posting signs around the dorms for severe weather events. If you are 
interested in helping out, please email Rachel at </font><a href="mailto:pres.isuams@iastate.edu" 
target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>pres.isuams@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Garamond"> .</font> 
<br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Next, she discussed the continuation 
of the HyVee grocery bag project. This is a project we began last year. 
We printed a template with safety precautions for severe weather events. 
Last year, it was limited to mostly the Ames area, but we would like 
to expand it to Ankeny and the Des Moines area. We asked the Central 
Iowa Chapter of the National Weather Association to help us get the 
word out and they have agreed to assist us. These bags will be put out 
around Severe Weather Awareness Week and will stay out until they are 
gone. We will be using last year.s design but altering the dates.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Lastly, Rachel announced the 90<sup>th</sup> 
AMS Annual Meeting in Atlanta, GA this January. This meeting is for 
students, faculty, and weather enthusiast in general. We highly encourage 
juniors and seniors to apply for the Student Assistant Program at </font><a 
href="http://ametsoc.org/meet/annual/studentassistantprogram.html" target="_blank"><font 
color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>http://ametsoc.org/meet/<WBR>annual/<WBR>studentassistantprogram.html</u></font></a><font 
size="3" face="Garamond">. We had one representative go last year but 
would like to have more go this year. Please email Rachel if you are 
interested.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Vice President Hoffman</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Matt began by thanking everyone on 
getting their clothing orders in for ISU AMS fall apparel. They should 
be ready in the next few weeks. Please keep an eye on your email for 
pick up dates. Also, another way to support the club is by buying a 
window cling for your car. These are only $5 and help represent the 
ISU AMS.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Next, the snowfall contest has begun! 
This is an easy contest that everyone can participate in. This contest 
involves you trying to predict when the first inch of snow will fall 
in Ames this year. All you need to do is sign up in Agronomy 3008. Put 
your name under the date on the calendar and please, only one person 
per day. Also, the last day to sign up is October 16<sup>th</sup>. The 
winner will receive a $25 gift card to a store in Ames!!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"> Since the ISU AMS homepage has Model 
Animator, Matt gave a short tutorial on how to use it. At the ISU AMS 
homepage, click on .Member Resources. then .Model Animator.. 
The username is .********. and the password is .*****.. There 
are four model runs and many different models, including the NAM and 
GFS. You can look at any surface in the atmosphere and can look at up 
to 16days in the GFS. You do not have to clear your current loop to 
add another. This way you can compare the similarities and differences 
in the models.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Lastly, we have been offered the opportunity 
to tour the Tornado Modulator in Howe Hall. We voted on times and Monday, 
October 12<sup>th</sup> at 1pm won. We will probably meet at the hall, 
but watch for emails for more information.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Treasurer Wittrock</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Dues were supposed to be paid by the 
29<sup>th</sup>, so please turn these in as soon as possible!! They 
can be put in the AMS mailbox in Agronomy 3010 (the office next to the 
map room).</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Our current balance is $3128.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Finally, Justin asked for everyone 
to look for research surveys on the AMS website. Please fill these out 
to help the seniors with their senior thesis research work. Almost anyone 
can take these, but please look at the requirements. Thank you!</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Social Chair Witter</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Due to the chance of rain, the bonfire 
was postponed and moved to October 9<sup>th</sup>. It is still at McFarland 
Lake Park and rides will be provided in the parking lot across from 
Agronomy at 6pm.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The Student/Faculty Dinner was a great 
success! Thanks to everyone that went and thank you Rachael for planning 
such an awesome event!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Rachael went on to talk about intramurals 
next. Broomball dues are $5 and curling dues are $3. Please pay these 
as soon as possible to Justin or the AMS Mailbox in Agronomy 3010. There 
were also signup sheets for volleyball and dodgeball. If you are interested 
in either of these intramurals, please email Rachael at </font><a 
href="mailto:social.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>social.isuams@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Garamond"> .</font> 
<br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">She then moved on to our upcoming 
events: a corn maze and ice skating! The corn maze is Friday, October 
16<sup>th</sup> at the Center Grove Orchard in Cambridge. It will cost 
$8 per person and you will pay this at the corn maze. We will probably 
leave Agronomy at 5pm and drivers are needed. There will be FREE ice 
skating at the ISU Ice Arena on Friday, October 23<sup>rd</sup> from 
8-11pm. Please bring your ISU card! Watch for emails from Rachael for 
more information.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Academic Chair Rabideau</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Shannon began by reminding everyone 
about the ISU AMS forums. These are located at: </font><a 
href="http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/forums/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/<WBR>ams/forums/</u></font></a><font size="3" 
face="Garamond">. They are used for Cy.s Eyes, classes, 
storm chasing, and general information, so check them out!</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">She then reminded everyone that you 
need to send your review leaders the exam dates for your class at least 
a week or two in advance. This way, the leader can set up a time that 
works for everyone for a review session. If you have not received an 
email from your session leader, please check your email again and your 
junk mail. If you did not receive an email, please contact Shannon to 
let her know that you would like to sign up or if there is a certain 
class that you want a review session for.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Shannon created a .Career Page. 
on the ISU AMS Homepage: </font><a href="http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/careers.php" 
target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/<WBR>ams/careers.php</u></font></a><font size="3" 
face="Garamond">. You can use this page to look for different 
career paths, scholarships, internships, and other opportunities. Check 
this out because there are A LOT of opportunities available for meteorologist!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Finally, please email Shannon if there 
is a certain electives class that you would like to recommend for others. 
These can be classes that fulfill requirements or that you just really 
enjoyed.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Webmaster Carletta</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Nick first announced that if you do 
not pay your dues, you will not be on the ISU AMS email list, <a href="mailto:isuams@iastate.edu" 
target="_blank">isuams@iastate.edu</a>. 
This means you will not get any emails sent to you about meetings, events, 
and other AMS opportunities, so please pay your dues! We will start 
using this list within the next two weeks.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">He also showed how to sign up for 
the forums. Go to the ISU AMS Homepage, click on .Member Resources,. 
then .Forums,. .Register.. Once you click that, put that you 
are older than 13 (assuming everyone is.), agree to the Terms of Agreement, 
fill out the information page using your full name (.JoBeth Minniear. 
for me...), and submit. Nick will then approve you.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Nick has begun a Google Calendar for 
us! There is a link from the ISU AMS Homepage. If you click on this 
link, you can see all of the upcoming events. dates and times. If 
you would like to add the AMS Calendar to your Calendar, click on the 
+Google Calendar in the bottom right corner of the page. Then accept 
when the screen pops up.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Historian Lueck</b></font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Ryan has updated the AMS picture board 
outside of Agronomy 3128! Take a look and see pictures from every event 
so far (including the Student/Faculty Dinner!). </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">He is also planning on updating the 
AMS Poster. If you attended the Career Fair, you have seen why this 
needs updated. The pictures are from at least 3-4 years ago, so we 
decided they need a little updating. We will have the new poster out 
for VEISHEA and any other events AMS attends.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Ryan has added a .This Week in Weather 
History. section to the Map Room. It will be updated weekly so check 
it out to learn some great weather history!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Finally, he reminded everyone that 
his goal is to get a picture of every member. Please help him out by 
bringing your camera to events and getting pictures! You can send the 
photos to Ryan, add them on the Facebook page, or upload them at </font><a 
href="http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/Photos/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/<WBR>ams/Photos/</u></font></a><font size="3" 
face="Garamond">.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Cy&#39;s Eyes on the Skies</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Ryan and Andy reported that there 
are a record number of new members attending Cy.s Eyes! Keep it up!!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There are no dues yet for Cy.s Eyes 
because ISU TV has not contacted Ryan or Andy yet. They will keep you 
updated if you attend the show.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There are new rules for Cy.s Eyes 
due to the high numbers of attendees:</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">1) If you were on air you cannot sign 
up for the show following the one you were just on.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">2) The one exception to 1) is if no 
one has signed up for a position 24 hours prior to the show, then you 
can sign up if you were on the last one.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">3) If you are in situation 1) and 
absolutely need to go on air for whatever reason talk to the producers 
and we will decide if that is alright.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">4) If you want to do a theme like 
show that will exclude certain individuals (ladies show, mens show, 
Minnesota show) there is a topic thread made to discuss on. Once the 
show is agreed upon by all members that will be on, talk to the producers 
and then they will post the show for you.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">These rules are also posted on the 
forums.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">If you want to show up for a show, 
go to the Cy.s Eyes on the Skies forum and respond to Ryan.s message 
for the four positions.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Cy.s Eyes meets every Monday and 
Wednesday at 6pm. Check it out!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Forecasting Contests</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Ryan gave a WxChallenge update. He 
showed how to submit a forecast: go to the ISU AMS Homepage, click on 
Forecast Contest, National Contest, click on .enter contest. in 
the top left corner of the page. Enter your username and password (email 
Ryan if you don.t remember), and enter your forecast: max and min 
temps, wind (in knots), and precipitation (in inches). On the left side 
of the page, there are a lot of links to help you forecast. Take some 
time to play around with these links and they will be very useful to 
you. Ask an upperclassman if you would like help understanding the data. 
Don.t forget to pay your $5 to Justin if you are participating!</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There has been talk on having a Forecasting 
Workshop. It will give a general idea on how to forecast and what tools 
to use. If you are interested, please email Ryan at </font><a href="mailto:ralliss@iastate.edu" 
target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>ralliss@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Garamond">. </font> 
<br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The Iowa Forecast Contest has also 
started. Jon was unable to come to the meeting, so Rachel gave an update. 
They are currently on their second period and Jeff Duda won the first 
period.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Iowa State Daily forecasting is also 
going well. The forecasts have looked great! Iowa State Daily is now 
printing the graphics in black and white, but we may talk to them and 
see if they will go back to color. There is a new email address for 
the people managing this project: </font><a href="mailto:kim.norvell@iowastatedaily.com" 
target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>kim.norvell@iowastatedaily.com</u></font></a><font size="3" 
face="Garamond"><WBR>. Please start using this email address! Please 
talk to Ryan if you would like to get involved with forecasting for 
the Iowa State Daily.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Outreach Chair Suess</b></font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Please start submitting pictures for 
next year.s calendar! Some have been submitted but we need more so 
we have a lot to choose from. You can turn in printed pictures, but 
please put your name on the back so Liz can return them after pictures 
are selected. All pictures need to be submitted by Friday, December 
4<sup>th</sup>. This gives you a chance to take some pictures over Thanksgiving 
Break of snow if possible!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Calendar sales forms are available 
on the website. Calendars are $12. You can print off the forms and turn 
them into Liz or the ISU AMS mailbox in Agronomy 3010 with the total 
amount due. Liz brought a calendar to the meeting to show. They are 
awesome!! If you have turned in a form and have not seen Liz to pick 
it up, please send her an email to set up a time.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">If you are interested in helping create 
next year.s calendar, please email Liz at </font><a href="mailto:outreach.isuams@iastate.edu" 
target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" 
face="Garamond"><u>outreach.isuams@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" 
face="Garamond">.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Finally, since there has been a debate 
over the past few years whether a severe weather calendar or a seasonal 
calendar is better, we voted on the issue. The seasonal calendar won 
by a landslide, so we will continue having a seasonal calendar.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>NCAR Presentation by Shannon Rabideau</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">We concluded the meeting with a presentation 
by Shannon about the NCAR Undergraduate Leadership Workshop in Boulder, 
CO. She attended this workshop this June for a week and met people from 
a variety of majors from all over the United States. She was nominated 
by the ISU faculty for this workshop and accepted.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">During this great opportunity, Shannon 
heard from many speakers from different areas of study, including: climate, 
satellite technology, forecasting, etc. She also participated in many 
activities during the week. These activities included: tours of many 
of the NCAR facilities in Boulder, Rocky Mountain National Park, several 
NCAR labs, and other interesting places in Boulder.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The main ideas Shannon took away from 
the workshop were:</font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Garamond">May end up in completely 
  different career path than what you planned on</font></li>

  <li><font size="3" face="Garamond">Take opportunities as they 
  come... they generally lead to new, interesting, and beneficial outcomes</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Garamond">The future of meteorology 
  is diversification, the combo of many fields of study</font></li>
  <ul type="DISC">
    <li><font size="3" face="Garamond">Think outside the box</font></li>
    <li><font size="3" face="Garamond">Don.t be afraid to pursue 
    what really interests you, even if you have to create a new program 
    of study</font></li>
    </ul>
  <li><font size="3" face="Garamond">Get to know others in your 
  field.they may have valuable insight</font></li>

</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">For more information on this Workshop, 
email Shannon at <a href="mailto:srab@iastate.edu" target="_blank">srab@iastate.edu</a> or go

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Rachel ended the meeting by thanking 
everyone who helped out at Clubfest and the Major Fair and by recognizing 
Rachael Witter for doing such an awesome job on the Student/Faculty 
Dinner. </font> <br></p>
