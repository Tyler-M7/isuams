<p>ISU AMS Meeting Minutes<br>
http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/<br>
February 23, 2010</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Garamond">Start Time: 7:03pm</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">After welcoming the attending members, 
President Hatteberg introduced JoBeth Minniear for a presentation about 
her CMMAP internship this past summer.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Presentation</b></font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">CMMAP stands for Center for Multiscale 
Modeling of Atmospheric Processes; JoBeth was located at Colorado State 
University in Ft Collins, CO. The CMMAP internship provides research 
experience and pays travel costs, housing, food, and a stipend.</font> 
<br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">To be eligible for this internship, 
you must have completed at least one year of college, have a GPA of 
or above 3.0, have an interest in learning about climate and weather, 
and be considering a career in atmospheric sciences or a related field. 
Students should apply because you get to participate in cutting-edge 
research and work with world renowned Atmospheric Science faculty. This 
research experience provides insight to what graduate school is like 
and helps students gain professional development skills. It will also 
help students be a more competitive candidate for graduate school and 
the workforce.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">During the internship, JoBeth plotted 
many variables associated with a high resolution tropical convection 
system. She also plotted the CAPE and CIN at the surface level of the 
simulation to find which level of the atmosphere should be used to 
calculate 
these severe weather indices. Her research was important because these 
processes are the reason clouds exist. It may also help improve 
forecasts 
in the future.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">If you have any questions or would 
like more information about this research opportunity, please contact 
JoBeth at <a href="mailto:secretary.isuams@iastate.edu" 
target="_blank">secretary.isuams@iastate.edu</a>.</font> <br> <br>
 <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>President Hatteberg</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Spring clothing orders are right 
around 
the corner, so we looked at two different designs for this year's 
t-shirt. Our shirt this year will have "I survived Winter 
'09-'10...", and "...and now we will survive the floods" will be on 
the back 
with a graphic. Watch for an email with more information about where 
to sign up and shirt prices.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There will be two NWS Storm Spotter 
Trainings in the month of March at Iowa State University. The 
Beginner's 
training will be Thursday, March 4<sup>th</sup> at 7:00pm in 4-H 
Building 
on campus. The Advanced training will be Tuesday, March 23<sup>rd</sup> 
at 7:00 pm in 2050 Agronomy. Rod Donovan will likely be leading the 
Advanced Training. Everyone should go if possible for a reminder on 
severe weather. These sessions last about an hour and are free to 
everyone.

talk earlier in the day. Dr. Wakimoto was a student of Dr. Fujita, and 
we are very excited to have him.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There will be a Weather Radio 
Programming 
Event with the NWA on Saturday, April 24<sup>th</sup> at HyVee. We will 
have a table set up by the door and there will be a display of Weather 
Radios right by us so the public can buy a radio and then get it 
programmed.

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There will be a critique session on 
Tuesday, March 2<sup>nd</sup>. You don't have to be a member of Cy's

</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There will be an introductory radar 
workshop with Andy Mair and Ryan Alliss coming up soon. This is for 
beginners and is about how to use GR2 Analysis. This is a great 
opportunity 
to get some experience with GR2!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Scott Lincoln and several other grad 
students at ISU have altered the GR2 program for the Radar Workshop 
at the Storm Conference. They asked us if we would be willing to test 
this out before the conference, so we will be doing this on March 8 
at 4:30 pm. We would like at least 10 people to come to this if 
possible. 
This is a good chance to practice issuing storm warnings, and you will 
get to see the actual results right after.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Tornado Chasing Information 
Session</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Since we live in Iowa and (most of 
us) love storms, we will be holding a tornado chasing information 
session. 
This will cover chasing tips, safety, and cover the basics for chasing. 
We will talk about what to bring with you chasing, things to be aware 
of when chasing with group and the forecasting of severe weather days. 
The ISU AMS does not have an official chasing club, but there is a 
discussion 
group on the Forums for those who would like to chase.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>WxChallenge update</b></font> <br>

WxChallenge 
page, so check out the new, sleek look! In the results section on this 
website, the yellow shading is people who are eligible for end of year 
challenge. Please try to remember to forecast daily, or you will be 
bringing our team down in the rankings.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Forecast Discussions have been moved 
to Monday at 4pm in Agron 3128. This is a great opportunity to see how 
upperclassmen and faculty forecast.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Past President Hobbs</b></font> 
<br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Justin Wittrock won the last period
