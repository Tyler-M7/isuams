</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>President Hatteberg</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Rachel began the meeting with an update 
on the HyVee Bags. Mindy Beerends, the president of the Central Iowa 
NWA, received a positive response regarding a HyVee in Des Moines. We 
are hoping to get several more HyVee stores to also use our bags. If 
we get all HyVee stores in Ames, Ankeny, and Des Moines to put our Severe 
Weather Safety Information on their bags, where do we want to expand 
to next year? If you have any ideas on where or how to expand, please 
email Rachel at </font><a href="mailto:pres.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank"><font 
color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Garamond"><u>pres.isuams@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" 
face="Garamond">.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There is a Meteorology Poster Session 
on Thursday, December 3<sup>rd</sup> from 3:30 to 5pm in Agron 3140. 
Please stop by if possible. The Undergraduate Research Symposium is 
Monday, December 7<sup>th</sup> from 1 to 4pm in Agron 3140. This is 
where the seniors will present the research they have worked on this 
semester. All students are encourages to come to start thinking about 
their own Senior Thesis project.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The Graduate Meteorology Club chose 
to sponsor JonQuel, 9-year-old boy, for Christmas through The Giving 
Tree program hosted by the Faculty Senate and Ames-ISU YMCA. The program 
benefits more than 90 local, disadvantaged children and we are asking 
for your generous donations to help support just one of these kids to 
help make their Christmas bright. A motion was made to donate $50 and 
passed unanimously. Rachel will send out an email to let everyone know 
what our money went toward.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Last year, Steph Melton hosted a CPR 
training session for interested members. Only a few members were interested 
in attending a session this semester, so it will be brought up again 
next semester.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Vice President Hoffman</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Matt first gave an update on the LAS 
Council. A large sum of money is put aside yearly to help support different 
clubs. This money is given in proportion to the number of members a 
club has. We received $800 due to our 75 members.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Window clings are still available 
for $5. These make great stocking stuffers!! Please see Matt or Rachel 
if interested.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The 14<sup>th</sup> Annual Severe 
Storms and Doppler Radar Conference in Des Moines at the Sheraton Hotel 
will be held March 25-27 this year. The non-member student rate is $75 
and the student member rate is $55. Last year we received partial reimbursements 
for the conference and are hoping to receive them again from the LAS 
Council this year. This conference is a lot of fun and a great experience. 
Broadcast, National Weather Service employees, researchers, and other 
meteorologists will be present. It is a great way to meet professionals 
in the meteorology field! It has beginner workshops, as well as advanced 
talks. You can stay in the Sheraton, but this is not required. At night, 
we usually go out with other students and professionals in the field.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Our current balance is $3886.58.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Please pay any dues you owe!! Many 
people still owe the chapter for intramurals, WxChallenge, and membership 
dues. The sooner you pay, the sooner Justin will stop bugging you. </font><font size="3"

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">An idea for our Spring Break Trip 
this year is Norman, OK and Houston, TX. We would be going to the different 
weather facilities in Norman and the Space Center in Houston. If you

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">An idea for an AMS float was brought 
up. We decided not to pursue it this year but will keep it in mind for 
future years.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Secretary Minniear</b></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Rachel Hatteberg and JoBeth Minniear 
were selected as Student Volunteers for the 90<sup>th</sup> Annual AMS 
Meeting in Atlanta, GA. The National AMS will cover hotel costs but 
not travel costs. The club motioned to give $50 each to help cover these 
costs and it passed. Thank you!</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Last year the AMS covered the cost 
for the ISU AMS Poser for the Annual Meeting. A motion was made to cover 
this cost again and passed.</font> <br></p>

Matt will be emailing our more information at a later date.</font> <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Our intramurals are cooling down for 
the semester. The women.s and one men.s broomball team had a game 
Wednesday night. Please get your curling and broomball dues in as soon 
as possible! If you signed up, but could not make any games, you do 
not need to pay. These can be given to a cabinet member or put in the
