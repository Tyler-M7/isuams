department.s 
faculty attended to meeting to watch the presentation. Matt Hoffman 
received the award for best senior thesis and Shannon Rabideau was the 
runner up. Congratulations for your honors! All the seniors put in an 
impressive amount of effort on these presentations and the overall 
quality 
was equal to that at a professional meeting.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>President Hatteberg</b></font> <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Since schedules change every semester, 
we sent around a mid-year survey. It included the preferred day and 
time of the meetings, as well as suggestions for things you would like 
to see done within the club (e.g. social events, outreach, etc).</font> 
<br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">It.s the time of the year to create 
a spring t-shirt design! These designs have included meteorology jokes, 
cartoons, and much more in the past. Please email </font><a

it will be decided at the next meeting. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Please consider joining the NWA! It 
is a great way to meet professionals in the meteorology field! We will 
keep the club informed on the meeting time and date of the next NWA 
meeting.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">We are trying to figure out ways to 
get more involved with the community. It was motioned and passed to 
donate $500 to the Red Cross to go to earthquake relief in Haiti. Half 
of the profits from the remaining calendars will be going to this cause. 
Many club members are also interested in getting involved in the local 
Ames area. If you have ideas of community service events we can 
participate 
in or an organization we can help sponsor, please email <a

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond"><b>Presentation</b> - <b>JoBeth 
Minniear 
&amp; Rachel Hatteberg</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">JoBeth and Rachel were chosen to be 
student workers for the 90<sup>th</sup> Annual AMS Conference in 
Atlanta, 
GA from January 16<sup>th</sup> to 21<sup>st</sup>. The first attended 
the Student Conference, then worked daily for a few hours and attended 
different presentations and evening events. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The Student Conference was on Saturday 
and the first half of Sunday. It began with some ice breakers so the 
students could meet other students from different schools. Invited 
speakers 
talked about the many different types of job opportunities in 
meteorology 
and how to prepare for graduate school. There were sessions where the 
speakers interacted with the students and a panel of young 
meteorologists 
talked to the students also. Some of the less known areas of meteorology 
include: space weather, forensic meteorology, and emergency management. 
There were over thirty schools represented at this conference.</font> 
<br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">The benefits of being a student worker 
is the networking, a $25 stipend daily, and the hotel and registration 
fees are covered. JoBeth worked the registration desk: checking people 
in and answering general questions. The best part of her job was 
networking: 
meeting many researchers, professors, and professionals in the field. 
Rachel worked with the A/V crew. She ran a computer and timer and 
assisted 
with technical difficulties. She also helped speakers upload their 
presentations. 
She enjoyed working with the different speakers and making 
contacts.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">There were many different aspects 
of meteorology covered, including: climate, forecasting, modeling, 
policy 
and society, hydrology, oceanography, chemistry, history, 
instrumentation, 
aviation, and many others. In the Exhibition Hall, graduate schools 
and a lot of meteorology companies tried to find new recruits. These 
companies included: SAIC, Lockheed Martin, NASA, NOAA, Vaisala, Harris, 
Raytheon, and a lot more. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Several evening events took place 
also. There was a party sponsored by Harris and many other companies 
at the Atlanta Aquarium one night. Another night consisted of company 
and school receptions. These receptions were great ways to meet Alumni 
from potential grad schools and potential employers. The award banquet 
took place on Wednesday night.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">Overall, this conference was a great 
way to meet professionals in the meteorology field. Many ISU alumni 
attended and were very interested in how the program was doing and what 
the students were interested in. Both JoBeth and Rachel would like to 
see more Iowa State students attend next year.s conference because 
it was such a great experience.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Garamond">End time: 8:15</font> <br></p>
