<b>Treasurer Update</b><br>
We have $920 in our account.<br><br>

<b>Forecast Update</b><br>
<ul><li>First Snow-We reopened the payment window for <b>tonight's meeting
only!!!!</b></li>
<li>AMS Contest-There's nothing really new to report, it just keeps going and
going and going and.....</li>
<li>National-We are forecasting for Minneapolis, MN at the moment.  Scores for
New Orleans, LA will be posted tomorrow afternoon.  Look for an email from
Janet Schenck.  Also, we set out clocks back on October 31st at 2 am, so this
means that forecasts will now be due at 6 pm instead of 7 pm.  Janet will email
you all to remind you of this change.</li>
</ul><br><br>

<b>Fundraiser</b><br>
Janet has called Hy-Vee and Sams Club about discounting the prices on bulk hot
chocolate.  Hy-Vee is the most helpful with this.  They are going to give us
half off the price of their hot chocolate mix.  Kari has the water heaters so
we're pretty good on equipment.  If you have anything helpful or any ideas,
email Janet Schenck (<script language="JavaScript"><!--
