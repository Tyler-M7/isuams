<b>Treasurer Update</b><br>
There is $906 in the account right now.<br><br>

<b>NWA Severe Storms Conference</b><br>
The cost for registration is $65; this does not include hotel costs.  We will
talk later about different hotel options.  In regards to registration, we took a
vote on rather or not to allocate money to help with these costs.  The vote
passed giving $3 per person to go towards registration.  The conference will
take place March 31st-April 2nd in West Des Moines.  This is a great way to meet
people from different schools and different professions. One highlight is Tim
Samarus who will present his latest video.  You can register at
<a href="http://www.iowa-nwa.com">www.iowa-nwa.com</a>.  Elise Johnson (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

<b>Weather Wow!</b><br>
So I decided to change our little Weather Segment of Fun to Weather Wow!  Here
is this months Weather Wow!<br><br>

So, since we signed up for the storm spotter
list, I thought this was interesting, In 1990, Cotulla, TX reported 97 mph
wind gusts!  Baylor University also reported damage of 8 light poles being
knocked over by the winds!  See, it's not too early to think of storm
chasing!<br><br>
