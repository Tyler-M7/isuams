with:<br>
<ul><li>Hot Chocolate Sale</li>
<li>Quiznos Fundraiser</li>
<li>Do our own car wash</li>
</ul>
Janet will send an email out later as she gets more information.<br><br>

<b>Social Events</b><br>
<ul><li>Flag football-Our team plays this Sunday at 5:30 on field 28.</li>
<li>Broomball-PAY ELISE IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID HER YET!!!  The guys lost their
first game, but they’re not done.  Look for an email from Elise for times
and dates of other broomball games.</li>

<li>Look for an email from Elise with information about all the other Intramural

<li>"Organized" Tailgate-Look for an email from Elise about games that we will
tailgate at.  If and when we tailgate, we will probably meet at north
parking lot.  Look for emails with information later.</li>
<li>Every home game tailgate-It was brought up that we should just tailgate for
all home games.  The problem is, is that AMS can not foot the bill for all
the games.  So, some AMS members would like to get together independently.
So, look for an email from Fitz (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

<b>After the meeting:</b><br>
Kari Kozak gave a presentation about the AMS Annual Meeting.  The meeting will
be held Jan 9th-13th in San Diego with a theme of "Building the Earth
Information System."  If you would like more information, go to the <a
href="http://www.ametsoc.org">National AMS
website</a>.  This is a great chance to meet and great with
professionals, get an intership or job, and a great learning experience.  The
cost is $150 for just registration, but you can get a Student Travel Grant or be
part of the Student Assistant Program.  To get a Student Travel Grant, you must
be a senior or a graduate student.  This grant will cover the round trip, hotel,
registration and breakfast cost.  This application must be filled out before
October 22nd.  You can find the application at the website given above.  For the
Student Assistant Program, you can be any type of student, although precedence
is give to National AMS members.  This will pay for hotel, registration, and
breakfast costs.  The deal is, is that you will work at the national meeting.
You will also get about a $30 stipend to spend elsewhere.  The application is
also online and is due before October 22nd.<br><br>

Chris Maiers also gave a presentation about the possibility of getting our
Doppler radar fixed.  The cost would be about $320,000, but the benefits are
beyond belief.  When fixed, it could be used for research and other student
activities.  This would also help with the public safety of not only Ames, but
Iowa as well.  There is also the great chance to have the Doppler radar be of
use to other programs here at Iowa State such as the electrical engineers.
There are other options.  We could get a Doppler on wheels which would cost
about $20,000.  We could also work with companies who are developing new radars,
like the bipolarization radar.  We could go the cheap way, but that would mean
less quality.  To get this, we need to start fundraising as soon as possible.
We could possibly get funds from the university, alumni, state grants, or
business partners.  The typical lifespan of a Doppler radar is about 15 years,
so upkeep is there, but not as much as the initial cost.  For more information,
email Chris Maiers (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

Sorry for the long minutes, but now, the section you've all been waiting for...<br><br>

<b>"Segment of Fun!"</b><br>
As we were sitting pretty today with a high of 76, look what happened on
September 30, 1989 - Thirteen cities reported record high temperatures for the
date, as readings soared into the upper 80s and 90s from the Northern and
Central High Plains Region to Minnesota. Bismarck ND reported a record high of
95 degrees, and the temperature reached 97 degrees at Broadus MT. Afternoon
thunderstorms developing along a cold front produced wind gusts to 60 mph at
Wendover UT. (from <a
