<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Benefits of ISU and National 
AMS</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">ISU AMS: 1.) Make good friends</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     
2.) Opportunities including tours of the NWS, a wind farm, severe storms 
conference, and                  
much more. Connections can be made from these experiences as well. </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">     
3.) Looks good on a resume: distinguish yourself by becoming involved. </font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">National AMS: A more professional 
group that you can be a member in during and beyond college. </font></p>
<ul>
<ol type="1">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Opportunities such 
  as the national convention in Seattle</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Get discounted rate 
  to subscription of BAMS which includes journal articles about weather. 
  Great resource for all, should start reading that type of material now 
  rather than later. </font></li>
</ol>
</ul>
 <br>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Weatherfest Update</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This springtime event will 
occur during VEISHA and will include several organizations from broadcasting, </font><font size="3" face="Calibri">Freese-Notis Weather</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 

and the NWS. While coordinating with Storm Ready, this will be a large 
and fun event. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Air Force Speaker</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Interest level was gauged and 
many approved of having an air force speaker come to ISU. Dates on exactly 
when this would occur will be detailed later.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>NWS Tour</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mindy Beerends will provide 
a tour on Thursday, Oct. 21<sup>st</sup> at approximately 7:00 pm. As 
this date gets closer, an email will be sent about carpooling: tentatively 
we&#8217;ll leave around 6:15 pm</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Ames Flood Donation</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">United Way will accept donations, 
but not volunteers. No one was opposed to donating, and after discussion 
an amount of $250 was agreed upon. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>AMS Going Green?</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The club decided to abolish 
the tradition of printing agendas for meetings. Agendas before the meeting 
and meeting minutes after will still be sent out via email. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Member Information Sheet</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Fill this out so we know when 
to set the next meeting to ensure maximum attendance. If didn&#8217;t complete 
it during the meeting, turn it into the AMS mailbox in 3010 Agronomy. </font> <br>

</p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Vice President

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Clubfest</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Will take place Wednesday, 
September 8 from 11-4pm. The goal is to have two people present at all 
hourly slots. A sign-up sheet went around, but more volunteers may be 
needed. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Fall Clothing Orders</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Clothing orders are due Friday, 
Sept. 24. Options include wind-breaker or fleece jackets with quarter

with your order into our AMS mailbox in 3010 Agron. Contact Pete Effertz 
(<a href="mailto:vp.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank">vp.isuams@iastate.edu</a>) if any questions arise. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>ISU AMS Window Clings</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">They are $5 each and can make 
a great gift! If interested, contact Pete (<a href="mailto:vp.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank">vp.isuams@iastate.edu</a>).</font><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font> <br>
</p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Treasurer 
Carletta</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Dues</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Club dues have been $10 in 
the past, and will remain so thanks to a club vote. Until dues are in, 
you won&#8217;t get on the ISU AMS list serve, but can still participate 
in group activities for a set length of time. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Current Balance</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Currently at $4008.16, but 
after upcoming expenses the balance should be near $3000. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Central Iowa Chapter of 
the NWA</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This is another group that 
consists of people from the NWS, broadcasters, and many other potential 
contacts that you could be with and get go know. This group does fundraising, 
weather radio sessions, and they put on the Severe Storms conference. 
Their first meeting will be on Sept. 20<sup>th</sup> a, and we usually 
organize carpools to go with them. Contact Nick Carletta (<a href="mailto:tres.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank">tres.isuams@iastate.edu</a>), 
JoBeth Minniear (<a href="mailto:pres.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank">pres.isuams@iastate.edu</a>), or Rachel Hatteberg (<a href="mailto:rah@iastate.edu" target="_blank">rah@iastate.edu</a>)

month&#8217;s weather history fact!</font> <br></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Social Chair 
Roney</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Bonfire</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Since Sept. 11<sup>th</sup> 
involves an away ISU vs Iowa football game, the club decided that Friday, 
Sept. 24<sup>th</sup> will be the date of our bonfire. Further details 
will be provided in time. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Golf Outing/Disc Golf</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Debate over which activity 
to participate in led to a vote &#8211; turns out both activities will 
eventually happen due to the vast interest in both. A Golf event will 
happen before disc golf and will probably take place at the Veenker 
golf course due to their Monday/Thursday group discount: 9 holes for 
9 dollars. Only problem is there will not be rental clubs available. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Student Faculty Dinner Update</u>  </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This event will be held on 
Thursday, Sept. 16<sup>th</sup></font><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">at Hickory Park and will start at 5:00pm. 
We&#8217;ll be meeting in parking lot north of Agronomy at 4:45pm. An email 
will be sent out on more details as the event approaches. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Intramurals</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Upcoming events are broomball, 
a sport similar to hockey but with a broom and tennis shoes ($5), curling 
($3), and flag football (free). Our new policy, &#8220;pay before you play,&#8221; 
will ensure nobody escapes paying these dues, which was an issue last 
year. If you weren&#8217;t at the meeting or didn&#8217;t have money with you 
at the meeting and want to play, you can either find a way to get it 
to Nick Carletta or drop it off in the AMS mailbox in 3010 in an envelope 
stating what the money is for. Emails will go out with more details 
later. </font> <br></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Outreach 
Chair Carter</b></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Calendar Update</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Calendars have arrived! Order 
forms were sent around for those interested in ordering calendars for 
family, friends, or whoever else. Cost will be $12 per calendar, $14 
if include shipping (indicate on the order form if you want them shipped). 
A great prize will be awarded to the top seller. The deadline for the 
contest is at the October meeting. As always, email Kristy (<a href="mailto:outreach.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank">outreach.isuams@iastate.edu</a>) 
if you have any questions. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Weather Photos</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It&#8217;s that time to start sending 
new photos for the 2012 calendar to Kristy at </font><a href="mailto:outreach.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>outreach.isuams@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Calibri">. We&#8217;re expecting some great shots from this 
summer&#8217;s flooding, tornadoes, etc. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Ames Schools Outreach </u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">First event is next week and 
that&#8217;s already been taken care of by volunteers, but don&#8217;t worry 
if you missed it &#8211; we have 22 more requests from high, middle, 
and elementary schools, so get involved in the future. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Any ideas on what the club 
can do for outreach or science night activities should be sent to Kristy. </font> <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Calibri">Fill out your class list on the sheet

them on the forums! Your posts will be accessible to anyone who has 
an account. </font> <br></p>
<p align="center"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Forecasting</b></font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>WxChallenge Information 
and Sign up</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This is a challenge put on 
by the University of Oklahoma and you get to forecast across the country 
throughout the school year. Forecasts are submitted Monday through Thursday 
each week, and we&#8217;ll start in Texas on Sept. 27. If you&#8217;ve never 
forecasted, is a good experience. Remember to forecast everyday if you 
do sign up, otherwise the team score from ISU will be compromised. The 
cost is 5 dollars for the year, but only 3 dollars per semester. To 
sign up, <b>you must have user name of 6 characters and a password of 
9 characters</b>.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Forecasting Sessions</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">These sessions will assist 
those forecasting in the WxChallenge, but feel free to attend even if 
you&#8217;re not involved in the WxChallenge. Sessions will be held every 
Monday at 5:00 pm starting Sept 27 in room 3128. Run by the graduate 
meteorology club, their members will lead discussions, but undergrads 
are encouraged to participate and lead as well. NowCasting will happen 
as well, so you can compete against people at the sessions. <b>Note:</b> 
These sessions will not be mandatory to attend if you&#8217;re involved 
in the WxChallenge, but they&#8217;d be a great help to your forecasting 
techniques. </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Iowa Forecasting Contest 
&#8211; Jon Hobbs</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This forecast contest&#8217;s domain 
is the state of Iowa and exists so you can practice your forecasting 
skills here in Iowa. This contest is similar to the national forecast 
since you forecast Monday through Thursday each week. However, differences 
include style of forecasting (will mimic an operational setting), will 
forecast for 2 to 7 days out at times, and will forecast not only for 
temperature and precipitation, but also wind, cloud ceiling, and visibility. 
Also, you forecast all year round&#8230; not just for the school year 
and participation is free. Participation is up to you &#8211; there 
are no guidelines for when you begin. For more information, visit the 
AMS homepage and click on the link for the Iowa Forecasting Contest. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Iowa State Daily Sign Up</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This opportunity allows you 
to forecast for the ISU Daily. Upperclassmen will lead groups of forecasters, 
and each group will be responsible for a day of the week to put out 
a 3 day forecast as well as a possible weather graphic and weather tidbit. 
The process takes around 25 minutes to complete.  </font> <br>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Historic Iowa Events</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Many events have occurred over 
the past 3 to 4 years in Iowa, and they will be displayed and updated 
on a poster throughout the year.  </font> <br></p>

attend</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>Storm Ready Update</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This event involves going around 
campus to dorms and other buildings to make sure people know what to 
do if a tornado strikes. We should get a hold of signs soon, so a sign-up 
sheet during the next meeting will go around to decide teams and times.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>HyVee Bags Update</u></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For the past couple years, 
AMS has been working with HyVee and their bags to include severe weather 
tips for floods, lightning, and tornados. This project may expand to 
the entire Midwest this year! </font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>First show</u> </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This show will be September 
13<sup>th</sup> or 15<sup>th</sup> (future email will clarify) and will 
only be a run through, not live. Cy&#8217;s Eyes is student run through 
ISU TV, so if you&#8217;re looking into broadcast meteorology, make an attempt 
to attend. If broadcast meteorology isn&#8217;t for you, this is still something 
to get involved in since cameras and sound systems still need to be 
run.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Since the production of the 
show will take place in the communications building (northwest campus), 
a group will meet in the northern parking lot for agronomy and head 
over together. This would be a good opportunity to check out how things 
are run, and if after the show you&#8217;re still interested, you can sign 
up at that time. The crew roster sign up is posted on the forums before 
every show, so sign up</font><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Times New Roman">. </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Note:</b></font><font color="#FF0000" size="3" face="Times New Roman"> </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Genesis, the graphic machine for the

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">This tour will occur on Tuesday, 
September 21<sup>st</sup> at 7:00 pm. If you&#8217;ve never been to a TV 
station, this would be a neat experience to see how everything works, 
plus we&#8217;ll get to talk to chief meteorologist Brad Edwards. Those 
who are attending will meet in the north agronomy parking lot at around 
6:30 pm.</font> <br></p>
