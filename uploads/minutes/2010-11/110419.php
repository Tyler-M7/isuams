April: </b></font><font size="3" face="Calibri"><b>04/03/1974 --</b> 

A &quot;Super-Outbreak&quot; of tornadoes ravaged the Midwest and the 
eastern U.S. Severe weather erupted early in the afternoon and continued 
through the next day. Severe thunderstorms spawned 148 tornadoes from 
Alabama to Michigan, most of which occurred between 1 PM (CST) on the 
3rd and 1 AM on the 4th. The tornadoes killed 315 persons, injured 5300 
others, and caused 600 million dollars damage. Alabama, Kentucky and 
Ohio were especially hard hit in the tornado outbreak. One tornado destroyed 
half of the town of Xenia OH killing 34 persons. Another tornado, near 
the town of Stamping Ground KY, produced a path of destruction a record 
five miles in width. A tornado raced through Guin AL at a speed of 75 
mph. Two powerful tornadoes roared across northern Alabama during the 
early evening hours, killing fifty persons and injuring 500 others.</font> <br>
