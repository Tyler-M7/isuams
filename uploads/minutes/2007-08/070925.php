<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A presentation was given by 
Rachel Butterworth on her REU research experience at the National Weather 
Center in Norman, Oklahoma.  This is a great opportunity for anyone 
interested in research or just wondering what research meteorology is 
all about.  This is a ten week all expenses paid summer research 
program at the National Weather Center, in Norman, Oklahoma.  The 
NWC is a collaboration of the Storm Prediction Center, National Severe 
Storms Laboratory and the Oklahoma University?s meteorology program.

U.S., you get to go on trips with fellow students and go storm chasing 
in the heart of tornado alley.  You actually perform research and 
give a presentation at the end the program.  To apply you should 
be of at least junior status.  Applications are available at </font><a href="http://www.caps.ou.edu/reu" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>www.caps.ou.edu/reu</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> in December and are due in February.
