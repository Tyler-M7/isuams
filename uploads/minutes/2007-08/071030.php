<p>ISU AMS Meeting Minutes<br>
http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/<br>
October 30, 2007</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Thank you for all that have 
been volunteering for Taking the Road Less Traveled and other community 
outreach programs.  Helping the community is a good way to get 
the AMS recognized and build our reputation as an organization. </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Congratulations to the whole 
Iowa State Chapter of the American Meteorological Society, as we made 
honor roll!!  We were only one of six in the nation in the AMS 
to make it.  Way to go, keep up the good work!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Symposium Posters</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Some 
seniors and graduate students doing a thesis are making posters of their 
 research.  This is a good way for them to put their research together 
and critique  it.  Funding of thesis posters is partially paid by 
the Graduate Club, but they can?t  pay for the all of the posters, 
so it was motioned to have the ISU AMS pay for  half of the posters.  
The motion passed.  The Symposium Poster Session will be  November 
14, 2007 in room 3140.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Resume Workshop</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There 
will be a resume workshop held November 8, 2007 in 3128.  This will 
be a  great opportunity for everyone to build their skills in writing 
a resume.  Everyone  is welcome, even if you don?t have a current 
resume.  Resumes are very important  in the working world and having 
one that looks professional could make or break  future employment opportunities, 
so be sure to show up!</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Winter Weather Safety and 
Preparedness</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We 
as a chapter have another way to interact with the community and show 
 community involvement.  The Winter Weather Safety and Preparedness 
fair will  be held Monday November 12, 2007 at 6:30pm.  The location 
is still to be  determined.  It will consist of talking to 10-20 
families about the hazards of  winter weather and how to be prepared 
and stay safe during the winter season.   Anyone interested can 
email </font><a href="mailto:cjohn@iastate.edu" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>cjohn@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> or </font><a href="mailto:rbutter@iastate.edu" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>rbutter@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> to sign up.   Suggestions on activities 
and ideas on how to present this talk should also be sent  to the same 
addresses. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Spring Break Trip</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Every 
year the ISU AMS takes a spring break trip to a destination somewhere 
in  the U.S. that can incorporate weather into the trip, along with having 
a blast of a  time!  At the moment suggestions are being taken as 
to where the club will go.   Destinations of the past have been 
to Colorado to visit NCAR, and Norman,  Oklahoma to SPC.  This is 
a fun way to spend your spring break and there?s no  better way to 
do that than spend it with all of your meteorology buddies.  Send 
 any suggestions to <a href="mailto:cjohn@iastate.edu" target="_blank">cjohn@iastate.edu</a>. </font> <br> <br>

 <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Apparel </b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
ISU AMS apparel that was recently ordered will arrive in before  Thanksgiving 
break, with a tentative date of November 13<sup>th</sup>, 2007.  
Orders will be  distributed in the map room when they arrive.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Calendars</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Calendar 
orders are due Friday November 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2007.  Try to sell 
as sell as many as  possible as it is pretty much our only fundraiser 
of the year.  This money is used  to fund things like food at meetings 
and reimbursing travel and such during trips.   This keeps funds 
in the AMS account so next year?s AMS will have funds to do  things 
with.  Our goal is to sell 250 calendars.  Sell them to any 
and everyone and  they make great gifts for family!  This year?s 
pictures are amazing and will make  for a great calendar.  To view 
the pictures that will appear on the calendar and to  get order forms

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Treasurer</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
current balance is: $4389.  It was motioned that the ISU AMS pay 
$1000 of  the calendars and this motion was passed.  So after this 
and paying for some  apparel, $2400 will be subtracted from our account.  
Also was motioned that the  club pay $100 to keep Cy's Eyes On The Skies 
on ISU TV.  So our approximate  balance will be: $1889 after all 
of these transactions take place.  The only way to  restock some 
of our funds is to sell those calendars so keep selling!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>NWA</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 
A former ISU AMS president Elise Johnson would like everyone to join 
her  group on facebook called National Weather Association.  The 
main point of doing  this is she would like for everyone to take a survey 
for the NWA making  suggestions on what would make the NWA more appealing 
to students our age.   The NWA is a great organization to be involved 
with.  If you aren?t a member and  want to become one visit:  <a href="http://www.nwas.org/membership/index.php#join_online" target="_blank">http://www.nwas.org/membership/index.php#join_online</a>. </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>FYI</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
tornado machine and supplies will be stored in room 3128 in cabinet 
on south  wall.  </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Also 
if anyone wants to help Chris go through all of the extra AMS stuff 
email  him at: </font><a href="mailto:cjohn@iastate.edu" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>cjohn@iastate.edu</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">.  Could be some interesting things 
that you could end  up investigating!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Academic chair</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Contact 
leaders of sections to be sure there will be reviews for sections.  
Everyone  is busy and if no one tells the leader there is a test, they 
won?t know to hold a  review session, so be sure and communicate with 
them.  Also keep checking  forums to see when reviews and such are 
held.  It has been brought to our  attention that Student Services 
wants tutors for meteorology 227 and  meteorology 206.  Please contact 
student services if anyone is interested.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Social chair</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
annual student faculty supper will be held Monday November 5<sup>th</sup>, 
2007  at 5:30pm at Hickory Park.  This is a great way to hang out 
with your favorite  meteorology professors without talking about all 
those derivations and have a  great meal at the same time!!  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Forecast contests</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">National 
Contest:</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Congratulation 
goes out to Brandon Engelson, Ryan Alliss, Jon Hobbs and Dr.  Bill Gallus 
for being the top forecasters of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina for  period 
one.  Congratulations also goes out to Jayson Prentice, Ryan Alliss, 
Jon  Hobbs and Dr. Bill Gallus for being the top forecasters for period 
two.  Great job  forecasters and keep up the good work!  If 
you are signed up for the National  Contest, be sure and forecasts otherwise 
it will bring our team score down and  drop our team ranking as a whole.</font> <br>

</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Local 
contest:</font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Congratulations 
to Chris Schaffer for winning period three in the local contest.  
If  anyone is still interested in signing up for the contest visit:  </font><a href="http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/AFC/" target="_blank"><font color="#0000FF" size="3" face="Times New Roman"><u>http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/AFC/</u></font></a><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Webmaster</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Please 
add pictures to photo albums on the forums.  </font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Cy?s Eyes</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Cy?s 
Eyes is going good, there was a new monitor added for the green screen.  
 Studios looking good, but there has been some controversy.  ISU 
TV is now  charging dues to be on channel 18.  So we now owe $100 
if Cy?s Eyes wants to  be on air anymore.  There was a motion 
to have the ISU AMS constitution  amended to have a broadcast meteorology 
committee be added to the constitution.   There also was a motion to 
have the organization pay for the $100 needed to stay  on air.  Both 
of these motions passed.  Then members who participate on Cy?s  Eyes 
will owe the ISU AMS $6 to cover the dues.  </font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Radar Workshop</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Scott 
Lincoln and Jason Patton will be hosting a radar workshop on Friday 
 November. 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2007 at 6:30pm.  This workshop will consist 
of learning how to  use Gibson Ridge Analyst Edition software and have 
real time storms that you  have to give live warnings on.  Sure 
to be lots of fun and a great learning  experience for all! </font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Historian</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Get 
pictures of AMS activities to Jeff ASAP!  Also need some pictures 
from the  2003-2004 school year. </font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Costume Contest</b></font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
costume contest was spectacular, with many great costumes.  The 
pack was  narrowed down and in the end Andy Mair, dressed as Jack sparrow, 
won the gift  card.  Be sure to tell him aye matey?. I mean congratulations!  </font> <br>
