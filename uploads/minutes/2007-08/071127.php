<p><font size="3" ><b>Storm Ready</b> </font></p>
<ul><p><font size="3" >The ISU campus needs to be updated 
on being storm ready.   We as meteorologists can help fellow 
students in being ready for severe weather and where to go during severe 
weather events by designating certain buildings and rooms for shelter.   
In order to achieve this we will have to check buildings separately 
to make sure that signs are hung and directions are given on where to 
go.  This is another great way for the AMS to get involved in the 
community.  If anyone wants to be involved in with this, please 
contact Chris (pres.isuams). </font></p></ul>

Tuesday December 4<sup>th</sup>,2007 in 3140!  Bring games and things
