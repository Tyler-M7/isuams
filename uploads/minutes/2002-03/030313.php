<p class="MsoNormal">Weather Instruments:&nbsp; Graduate students Dave Flory and Eric
Aligo, presented us with a proposal to buy weather instruments.&nbsp; There are
instruments on the roof of agronomy that are wired to a Davis Weather Station in
the map room.&nbsp; They would like to get all the instruments in good working order
and make this data available for everyone-it could help in some senior theses or
instrumentation projects.&nbsp; They are asking us to help pay for the Temperature
sensor and ventilated shield for this sensor.&nbsp; The temperature sensor is $23,
and there are two options for shields.&nbsp; $72.50, and the other is $187.50.&nbsp; The
more expensive one is obviously better than the other-it is fan-aspirated.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you were not at the meeting you may want to look at the presentation and/or
proposal on the web before making a decision on this.&nbsp; We will vote on this
through email in the next week as well.</p>
<p>One last thing-if you ordered shirts, and haven't picked
them up please do so.&nbsp; And if you haven't paid, do that so we have money!</p>
Penny Zabel<br>Secretary<br><br>
