***We will be cleaning out the mail list after this email is sent. Those 
people who have been to one of the meetings will stay on the list. If you 
haven't been to a meeting but still want to be on the list, please email me.</p>
<p>We had another great turnout for the meeting tonight. I don't know an exact 
number, but there were around 60 people.</p>
<p>Speakers: We are working on lining up speakers for some of our meetings. Some 
idea have been : Jason Parkin, KCCI weather, Erik Rasmussen, NSSL i believe, Jim 
Moore from Missouri, Paul McKowsky from Penn State, or Jeff Johnson on Andy Kula 
from DSM NWS. We are looking into getting funding from national AMS to bring a 
speaker in. We'd probably have more luck getting this if we got more people 
being members of the national chapter. Applications should be available at the 
next meeting.</p>
<p>Banner/T-shirts: Jenny is looking into costs for a banner. T-shirts: there 
are a few sweatshirts left. A paper was sent around for more orders, and we will 
be ordering more soon. If you did not make it to the meeting and want to order a 
shirt, email Jenny Riese ( <script language="JavaScript"><!--

var sb_domain = "iastate.edu"

var sb_recipient = sb_user + "@" + sb_domain
var sb_url = "mailto:" + sb_recipient
document.write(sb_recipient.link(sb_url));
// --></script> ). T-shirts will be $10, and sweatshirts $20.</p>
<p>We also want to get designs for this years AMS t-shirts. if you have any 
design ideas, draw or write them up and get them to a cabinet member or to the 
AMS box in the Meteorology office by next Thursday. We will vote on a design at 
the next meeting.</p>
<p>There is a local boy scout troop that would like us to speak to them about 
severe weather. Brandon will be getting more information about this.</p>
<p>First Snow contest: We're going to try it again...hopefully we actually get 
snow (not that i want snow...but last year it was won by default because it 
didn't snow until January or February.) Entries will be $1 each. You pick a day 
you think we will get our first official inch of snow. To make it easier we use 
the national weather service official measurements in Johnston. Whoever is 
closest to the day will get a portion of the money. Details have not been 
decided on for sure. More information will be sent about this later...or we'll 
wait until the next meeting.</p>
<p>National AMS: Brandon will get applications for this and have them for the 
next meeting.</p>
<p>Intramurals: There were not enough people for a volleyball team. There are 
two Curling teams. The teams are: Brian Tentinger, Jenny Riese, Jeremiah 
Birdsall, and Chase VanValkingberg and team 2: Penny Zabel, Chris Paxton, Jeremy 
Grams, and Aaron Toddy. Team 1 plays Sunday at 11:30pm, and team two plays 
Tuesday at 11:30pm. If you can, go root on our teams. I know that team 2 plans 
to go watch team 1's game...so if you want to go and need a ride get ahold of 
someone from team 1.</p>
<p>Bowling: We're planning a social bowling event Sunday Sept. 29 at the 
Memorial Union bowling alley. If you did not sign up at the meeting but still 
want to attend, email Brandon (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

var sb_recipient = sb_user + "@" + sb_domain

document.write(sb_recipient.link(sb_url));
// --></script>) we want 
to get an idea of how many people plan to attend so we know how many lanes to 
reserve. If you have questions about this email Brandon or Brian also.</p>
<p>Tailgate: We're planning our annual tailgate for homecoming weekend...October 
12. It's before our next meeting, so more details will probably be sent out as 
it gets closer. We NEED a truck! and it anyone has a grill they'd let us borrow, 
that would be good too. We do have one. More than one wouldn't be a bad thing.</p>
<p>Forecast Contest: 32 people are signed up for the contest...all paid. We're 
doing pretty well so far for Corpus Christi...though as I type this they've 
jumped up to cat 5 precip on a day when not one person in the contest forecasted 
cat 5. We were tied for first place as a group, but that may change if other 
schools forecasted more precip then we did for today. The next city is Fargo 
starting next week. If you don't want to forecast for a period you need to let 
Jeremy know by the Thursday before so he can take you out for that city.</p>
<p>Trips:</p>
<p>Minnesota: November 9th, science museum...more details later TV Station/NWS: 
In December...again...more details later.</p>
<p>NEXT MEETING:</p>
<p>October 17 at 6:30.</p>
<p>The location may change due to our attendance and the not-so-expansive space 
we have in the meteorology department. Stay tuned for details on this also.</p>
<p>That's it for now.</p>
