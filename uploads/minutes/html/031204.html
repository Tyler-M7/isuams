where you register is www.iowa-nwa.com.  There will be speakers talking 
about the tornadoes in May and June from this past year.  There will also 
be a storm chasing video night where there will be some excellent videos 
presented.<br><br>

 

    * We will be hosting an Advanced Storm Spotter Training session 
sometime in March/April.  The NWS has approached our organization about 
setting this up.  Andy Kula with the NWS will be leading the 
training.<br><br>

 

    * Feb. 23 we will be presenting a 30-40 minute presentation to a 
middle school.<br><br>

 

    * VIESHEA information is beginning to come out.  It will be held on 
April 18th this year which is a Saturday.  We will set up an educational 
booth underneath Cy?s Big Top on central campus.  Any ideas for games or 
other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  More information will be 
provided on this event in the spring.<br><br>

 

    * We failed to have a quorum at the meeting tonight, thus, we did not 
vote for a social chair.  We will vote at our first meeting in January.  
Jon appointed Mike Holts, Kari Kozak, and Elise Johnson to the social 
chair committee until an election can be held.<br><br>

 

    * T-shirt/Sweatshirt colors were voted on at the meeting.  The winners 
were red with white lettering and gray with red lettering.  We may have 
some other choices included beyond these two.  We will be ordering 
t-shirts/sweatshirts next semester.<br><br>

 

    * Finally, Jon Hobbs presented information on the Career Leaders in 
Science Conference held in Boulder from June 17-23 this last summer.  Nate 
will be posting Jon's presentation on the chapter website.  Anyone 
interested in more information for this conference for next year can visit
