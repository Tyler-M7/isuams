var sb_recipient = sb_user + "@" + sb_domain
var sb_url = "mailto:" + sb_recipient

// --></script>).  The conference is at the
Embassy Suites in Des Moines.  Events will include
talks on last spring's tornado outbreak in Oklahoma,
Kansas, and Missouri, a storm chaser video night, and
workshops on radar and severe weather.  The conference
begins at 3pm and as a great opportunity for contacts
and connections in the meteorology field.<br><br>

Kari is continuing to organize the VEISHA booth set
up.  Veisha will be April 17.  We are currently having
difficulty in obtaining a Cy's BigTop spot, so we may
end up having our display in another area.  We still
need to decide on a game to play.  E-mail Kari at

Next week (March 29-April 2) is Severe Weather
Awareness Week.  ISU AMS will be participating in the
week by giving numerous weather talks to elementary
schools around Ames.  These 45 minute talks will need
about three people each.  A sign-up sheet was past
around, but there are still more openings, and an
e-mail will be sent out soon with sign up information.
 There will also be other talks the following week
(April 5-9) as this will work better for some of the
elementary schools.  April 1 is Fellows Elementary
School Science Night.  We will be having a booth at it
with our tornado machine on display.  We are in need
of a vehicle to help transport the tornado machine. 
Volunteers are needed from 4-8pm that night.  E-mail

Mike discussed Intramurals.  Our soccer team won by
forfeit last night (Tuesday).  The next game is
tomorrow night (Thursday), so if you aren't going to
the conference, go and play!  IM volleyball is being
played tonight, and broomball starts April 4.  E-mail

sign up for Intramurals.  A camping trip is being
organized April 23 (Friday) or April 24 (Saturday).  A
sign up sheet was passed around at the meeting.  We
need to decide on which night as well as the
location...the following choices are available: 
Saylorville, Ledges S.P., Little Wall Park, or Don
Williams Park.  E-mail Mike with your preferences if
you want to go.<Br><br>

ISU AMS/Meteorology t-shirts are in and will be picked
up soon.  Pick them up from Jon whenever you see him
(if you ordered them).  They will also be brought to
the next meeting for pick-up.  You can e-mail him as
well to arrange a time to get your shirts(s).<br><br>

A tour of the Virtual Tornado in Howe Hall is in the
works through Dr. Gallus.  This will likely occur in
Late April.<br><br>

Kari gave a presentation on the Spring Break Trip to
Norman, OK.  See showed photos of visits to the
National Severe Storms Laboratory, the National Severe
Weather Center, the Oklahoma City Zoo, the Oklahoma
City Bombing Memorial, as well as others.<br><Br>

The total gas money for the three cars was $261.58.  A
motion was seconded and put to vote to provide a total
reimbursement of $200 to be divided between the 3
drivers.  There were likely not enough voters for a
quorum, so please send votes to Jon saying whether or
not you want to approve the $200 reimbursement if you
did not attend the meeting.<br><br>

Jeremy discussed the National Collegiate Weather
Forecasting Contest.  Jon won the national contest for
the city of Flagstaff, AZ, becoming only the 2nd ISU
student to win two or more plaques in the contest. 
Iowa State's top 5 finishers ranked 4th for Flagstaff,
and are 7th overall.  All forecasters are a combined
16th overall.  There are five forecasters in that top
100 cumulatively, led by Dr. Gallus.<br><br>
