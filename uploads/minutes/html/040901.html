<b>Member Intro:</b> Nice to meet all of you!<br><br>

<b>Social Events</b><br>
<ul><li>Intramurals-Flag Football, we need people!!!  Email Elise if you are
interested in the following intramural sports: Curling, Soccer, Cross
Country, Broomball, 5K Wilderness Run, Basketball</li>
<li>Basketball-Tuesdays (maybe Thursdays) at 9pm at the Rec Center (west end). 
Look for Elise and a Tall Blonde (The Tall Blonde's name is Amy)</li>
<li>Picnic-Tomorrow!  You can still come if you didn't RSVP.  If you need a
ride, meet us (Elise and I will be there) on steps by the north parking lot
by 5pm.</li>
<li>Start of the Year Social Event-A possibility would be to see Anchorman at
the Dollar Theater.  Look for an email later.  Other options are bowling, a
picnic, and many more.  Again, look for an email from Elise later on.</li>
<li>Co-Social Chair-This will be a sophomore position.  The sophomore class will
be asked to stay after next meeting.  We'll vote then on who will have
the position.  The duties of the position will be to help Elise with social
events and to be available for younger members to talk to them instead of
the "big scary upper-classmen!"</li>
<li>National Weather Service-The date for a visit to the National Weather
Service has been set to September 13 at 7pm.  We will meet in Agronomy
and leave from there.  If you have any questions, email Heather
Moser.</li></ul><br><br>

<b>AMS Dues</b><br>
In the past, the AMS dues have been $5.  We took a vote and decided that the
dues will be $5.  Please pay Brian Viner by the next meeting.  Make sure to get
all the information from Brian.  Checks can be made out to ISU AMS. <br><br>

<b>Apparel/Merchandise</b><br>
We will talk about WHAT we want to order at a later meeting, but for this
meeting, we have decided to make an order sometime this fall.  If you have any
ideas, email Elise.<br><br>

<b>First Snowfall Contest</b><br>
We voted to organize a First Snowfall Contest.  This contest involves picking
the date that you think will have the first snowfall.  If you don't quite
understand this contest, don't worry, more information will be given
later.<br><br>

<b>National Forecast Contest</b><br>
There was a meeting for the National Forecast Contest after the AMS meeting.  If
you were not able to be at the NFC meeting, email Janet Schenck for
information.<br><br>

<b>AMS Forecast Contest</b><br>
It's free!!!!  For more information on the AMS Forecast Contest, go to the AMS
website and click on the AMS Forecast Contest link.  For more information, email
Jeremy Grams (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

var sb_url = "mailto:" + sb_recipient
document.write(sb_recipient.link(sb_url));
// --></script>).<br><br>

<b>CY's Eyes on the Skies</b><br>
CY's Eyes on the Skies is a 15 minute weather show on ISU TV Channel 18.  Next
Wednesday there will be a training session at 6:30 in Studio B in the
Communication Building.  Even if you don't want to be go into broadcast
meteorology, it's a wonderful, wonderful experience!  There are also
behind-the-scenes positions available.  The possible starting date will be
Monday, September 13th.  Look for an email with more information!<br><br>

<b>National Weather Association</b><br>
The National Weather Association is a lot like AMS, but with a little bit more
focus on broadcasting.  This is a great way to meet people young and older! 
There are professionals from the National Weather Service and other occupations
that are members as well.  Email Elise Johnson if you're interested.  The big
event for the NWA is The Severe Storms Conference in the spring.<br><br>

<b>National AMS</b><br>
There is a $15 due ($7.50 now and then in January) to join the National AMS. 
This is a wonderful organization to sign up for because you can get great
benefits like discounts on magazines, you can find out about opportunities in
the meteorological field and much more.  The National AMS also holds a national
conference in San Diego in January (This is a great chance to learn outside the
classroom from many different professionals).  A great opportunity!<br><br>

<b>Way in the Future Events</b><br>
<ul><li>Storm Spotter Training- A great way to learn how to spot severe storms! 
Look for that in March.</li>
<li>Spring Break-More information will come MUCH later.  Past trips have
included Colorado, Oklahoma, and Florida.</li>
<li>Elementary Education-We go around to elementary schools teaching kids about
severe weather.  We do this in the spring.</li>
<li>Severe Storms Conference-Some much fun!  Again, this is a great way to learn
outside of the class room.  Another chance to meet people and make
contacts.  This is a spring event, so look for info later.</li></ul>

<b>Future Events:</b> National Weather Service, AMS/Faculty Dinner, Offit
Airforce Base, Tailgate with University of Illinois (September 18th) and
much more.<br><br>

Wow!  That was a long one.  Thanks for taking the time to read through this!  As
I promised, here is the "Segment of Fun!"<br><br>

<b>"Segment of Fun!"</b><br>
On this September 2, 1950 the town Mecca, CA received a high temperature of 126
degrees!!!  The low that morning was 89 degrees!  The high of 126 degrees set a
U.S. record for the month of September.  It may be hot this week, but not that
hot!!!(I got this from <a
href="http://www.weatherforyou.com/history">www.weatherforyou.com/history</a>)<br><br>

P.S. You don't have to email me back anything (you could if you want to!).  This is just a piece of information that you can have.
