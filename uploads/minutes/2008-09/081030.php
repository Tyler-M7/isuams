  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">We met with Dave 
  Bunker of the Department of Residence regarding StormReady, and we will 
  be going into the residence halls on Saturday, 8 November and Sunday, 
  16 November.  On 8 November, we will be going into the Union Drive 
  Association residence halls, and on 16 November, we will be going into 
  the Richardson Court Association residence halls.  We will start 
  at 2 PM on each day.  We need to identify safe shelter areas, determine 
  the placement of shelter signs, and the location to put general information 
  signs.  We need about eight people each day to help.  The 
  more the better, that way we can get done quicker.  We will also 
  have food provided to those who help on these days.</font></li>
