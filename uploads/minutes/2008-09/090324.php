<p>ISU AMS Meeting Minutes<br>
http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams<br>
March 24th, 2009
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">President Schwedler called 
the meeting to order at 7:00 PM.  He welcomed all who were present 
to the meeting.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>President Schwedler</b></font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Schwedler started 
  with the ISU AMS T-shirt design selection.  We went over the designs 
  for our new T-shirt, which there were three ideas total.  Discussion 
  was held regarding these ideas.  The ideas went to a vote, and 
  the chapter voted in favor of Mr. Karsten.s design.  You have 
  the option of getting your shirts in many different colors.  Each 
  shirt will cost about 10 dollars, and they should be in before the summer 
  break.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Next, we discussed 
  the Meteorology Alumni Luncheon.  This will occur on Saturday, 
  4 April from 11:30 AM to 1:00 PM.  It will be at the Rock Bottom 
  Brewery, east of where the NWA conference will be held.  Come and 
  see our alumni and have some fun!</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">NWS Advanced Storm 
  Spotter Training will be held on Monday, 6 April at 7:00 PM in 2050 
  Agronomy Hall.  It will be much like Meteorology 206, so don.t 
  worry if you have never accomplished any training before.  It.ll 
  be very informative, and it will discuss several aspects, including: 
  safety precautions, what to look for during dangerous weather, where 
  you should go for shelter, etc.</font></li>

  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There will be a 
  community preparedness event in Ames on Saturday, 25 April.  It 
  will act as a thank you to the workers and volunteers of the Parkersburg 
  EF5 and the Eastern Iowa floods.  We will be there to demonstrate 
  the virtual storm to those in attendance, to help them better understand 
  what to look out for in times of dangerous weather.  We require 
  2 to 4 people to help with this event.  We.ll contact you when 
  the time gets closer and plans come together regarding this event.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Vice President Deppe</b></font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There will be a 
  Career Panel held before the next meeting.  A date will be announced 
  soon.  We will have many professional meteorologists, such as National 
  Weather Service personnel, professors, broadcast meteorologists, private 
  sector, etc.  This is a great opportunity to ask questions, inform 
  yourself, and to help you determine what you wish to do with meteorology.  
  The Career Panel will be held the week before the next meeting in April.  
  Keep an eye on your inboxes for the date and time.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Come and help at 
  the ISU AMS table during VEISHEA.  The event will be on Saturday, 
  18 April, from 9 AM to 4 PM.  The tent that we will be set up at 
  will be the LAS tent on central campus, just south of Catt Hall.  
  We.ll do many interactive things for people who come to our booth, 
  such as face painting with weather symbols, weather trivia, videos and 
  more!  A sign-up sheet was sent around for people to designate 
  when they can help.  If you have any more ideas, send them to Mr. 
  Deppe at <a href="mailto:vp.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank">vp.isuams@iastate.edu</a>.  We need about 5 people per 3 hour 
  time slots.  The set-up for the table will be at 8 AM that morning.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">KaleidoQuiz Update:  
  Liz Suess thanked all who attended KQ.  Out of 22 teams in all, 
  we placed 12<sup>th</sup>.  We had issues regarding paying for 
  the travel question, which lead our group to Chicago, Illinois and back 
  to Ames.  Jason Patton spoke about having the ISU AMS to reimburse 
  the people who went on the trip for gasoline, and a stay in a hotel.  
  The total amount spent was roughly 100 dollars.  A discussion was 
  held on if/how much we should reimburse.  A motion was made to 
  cover the entire travel question.s cost, and it was seconded.  
  Discussion was held, and it was put to a vote.  The motion to reimburse 
  for the travel question was passed.</font></li>

</ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>Treasurer Karsten</b></font></p>
<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Our current balance 
  is around 3,900 dollars.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Mr. Karsten began 
  discussion of which model to purchase for the new AMS station on the 
  roof of Agronomy Hall.  We took a look at our four options, which 
  were all Davis stations.  All of the new station models are wireless, 
  and they have many great sensors and proper instrumentation protection 
  (radiation shield, etc).  The range of the costs for the stations 
  was from 595 to 1195 dollars.  A discussion was held on which station 
  we should get, with the main concern being the money we would have left 
  over by the end of the semester.  A motion was made to vote on: 
  1) If we wish to get a UV and solar radiation sensor, 2) If we would 
  like to get a fan-aspirator, and 3) Vote on the model we chose.  
  Voting was held for these three motions.  The UV/solar radiation 
  sensor vote passed, the fan-aspirator didn.t pass, and the chapter 
  voted on the Davis station with UV/solar radiation sensor without the 
  fan-aspirator.  This motion passed, and the station will be set 
  up by late spring or early summer.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There has been no 
  response from Dave Bunker regarding StormReady.  We are awaiting 
  his ideas for our next course of action.</font></li>

  on Sunday, 9 April, and softball Tuesday, 31 March at 5:20.  The 
  broomball schedules should be out now.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">There is a possible 
  social event on 5 April at Dave Flory.s house.  It.ll be another 
  hockey game day between the Minnesota Wild and the Detroit Red Wings.  
  Game time is 11:30 AM, and we will be leaving Agronomy Hall at 11:15 
  AM.  Lunch will be served.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The annual Spring 
  picnic is tentatively to be held on the Sunday before Dead Week, 26
