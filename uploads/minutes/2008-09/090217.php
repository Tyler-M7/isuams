<ul type="DISC">
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The revamping plans 
  for the new tornado machine were brought up.  Andrew Mair spoke 
  about the new plans, since our current tornado machine is not superlatively 
  functional.   Mr. Mair described the plans for a new machine, and 
  the parts that were essential to the creation of it.  Discussion 
  was held regarding the tornado machine and the costs.  Voting will 
  occur at a future date.  Construction should be completed over 
  Spring break, so it would be ready for VEISHEA.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">For our upcoming 
  VEISHEA celebration, we will have a spot in the College of Liberal Arts 
  and Sciences tent.  It will be the large tent near Catt Hall.  
  We have had the tornado machine, posters, radar images, videos, etc. 
  in the past.  Any new ideas for VEISHEA are welcome.  Things such 
  as providing hot chocolate, or some other beverage, and showing chasing 
  videos were brought up.  The next meeting, we will have a sign 
  up sheet for people who are willing to work at the ISU AMS table.  
  We will only ask you to do a few hours of time to be there.  If 
  you have any other ideas, please contact Mr. Deppe at <a href="mailto:vp.isuams@iastate.edu" target="_blank">vp.isuams@iastate.edu</a>.  
  We usually set up at about 10 AM and take the table down at around 4 
  to 5 PM.</font></li>

  from Liberal Arts and Sciences for the National Weather Association.s 
  Severe Storms and Doppler Radar Conference.  We will be getting 
  about 30 dollars reimbursement per person from the LAS for those attending 
  the conference.  If you still wish to sign up for it, it is not 
  too late.  Please sign up ASAP.  If you wish to go, email 
  your information (name, email, and in-session street address) to Mr. 
  Deppe.  Be sure to do this by Sunday, 22 February.  The registration 
  fee is 70 dollars for non-NWA members.  The conference is Thursday, 
  2 April through Saturday, 4 April, at the West Des Moines Sheraton Hotel.  
  There will be much to see, including featured speakers Tim Samaras, 
  recounts of the Parkersburg, Iowa EF5 tornado, and the Eastern Iowa 
  flooding.  We will also bring in broadcasters from KCRG-TV9 and 
  KWWL-7 that covered the Eastern Iowa flooding and the Parkersburg, IA 
  EF5 tornado.</font></li>
