Iowa State University Student Chapter of the American Meteorological Society<br>
August 30, 2005
<p>Prior to the meeting, the cabinet met with the freshmen and transfer meteorology
  students. The purpose of the meeting was to introduce each other and generally
  break the ice between both groups. The freshmen/transfers felt that this meeting
  was helpful.</p>
<p>Introductions &#8211; Cabinet members introduced themselves first, followed
  by the rest of the members. Again, this was mostly for ice-breaking in addition
  to reacquainting with each other. Brian Viner will be the liaison between the
  Graduate AMS and the regular ISU AMS chapter. </p>
<p>Surveys &#8211; Surveys were passed out at the beginning of the meeting. We
  hope to gain some insight on what the members want out of the organization
  this year as well as classes so the Academic Chair can help organize study
  groups. If you weren't at the meeting, please fill out the survey and email
  it to Elise Johnson (elisevj@iastate.edu).</p>
<p>National Membership &#8211; Liz White (edw@iastate.edu) encouraged the group
  about being National AMS members. Forms are available for becoming members.
  The cost is $7.50 for the remainder of the year, and renewal is in January
  for $15.00. All National members receive the Bulletin of the American Meteorological
  Society. Please return your form to a cabinet member or the AMS mailbox in
  3010 Agronomy by September 9.</p>
<p>Treasury Update/Dues &#8211; Current balance is $1042.73. Dues last year were
  $5.00. By vote, dues will again be $5.00. Checks can be made to ISU AMS. Cash
  or check should be given to Heather Moser (miraje@iastate.edu).</p>
<p>Academic Chair &#8211; Elise talked about the weekly seminars and then talked
  about a new Academic Chair, who would be in charge of promoting seminars as
  well as organizing group study sessions. The only nomination was Chris Maiers
  (biff016@iastate.edu), who the Cabinet will appoint as the new Academic Chair.
  Anybody interested in tutoring for any classes should contact Chris.</p>
<p>Sophomore Chair &#8211; The sophomore chair would act as a liaison between
  the underclassmen and the Cabinet, since all Cabinet members are upperclassmen.
  This worked well last year. Nominations will be taken prior to the next meeting,
  and a Sophomore Chair will be elected at that meeting.</p>
<p>Forecasting Contests (NCWFC and Local) &#8211; Heather discussed the Local
  Forecasting Contest, which involves forecasting for various elements and times
  for sites in Iowa. Jeremy Grams will be providing more information on this
  contest on Thursday, September 8 at 7:00 p.m. Janet Schenck (thatsme@iastate.edu)
  is our local manager for the NCWFC, which she stated is a national competition
  including both students and professors. She did a presentation after this meeting;
  see below.</p>
<p>Cy's Eyes on the Skies &#8211; Janet and Matt Teller (mteller@iastate.edu),
  co-producers of the show, informed the group about the Cy's Eyes. It is a 15-minute
  show airing twice per week on ISUtv Channel 18. However, we now have the studio
  reserved for 30 minutes, so we are able to air packages or special reports
  for those interested. It is a great opportunity even for those not interested
  in broadcasting. The first show is Wednesday, August 31. This will be a practice
  show for veterans. The following Monday will likely be a practice show, and
  Wednesday should be live. We hope to have the Genesis graphics computer running
  by that time, with the logistics worked out. Please arrive at Studio B in the
  Communications Building by 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Social Chair Update &#8211; Liz went over social activities, including field
  trips, intramurals, football tailgating, that the AMS group participates in.<br>
  Intramurals: Sand volleyball is a Labor Day tournament &#8211; we need players!
  Email Liz ASAP if you want to play. Flag football (mens' and womens' teams)
  will take place over several weeks during the fall. Again, we need people to
  play, and email Liz ASAP. Liz will inform the group of other intramurals as
  the signup dates approach. For more information, visit recservices.iastate.edu
  and click &#8220;Intramurals.&#8221;<br>
  Meteorology Basketball Night is Wednesdays at 9 p.m. at Lied Rec.<br>
  Tailgating: Liz will send out information about AMS Tailgating before home
  football games; let her know if you're interested.</p>
<p>Geoff's Book Review &#8211; Geoff Grochocinski (grgforce@iastate.edu) is doing
  weather book reviews this year involving the history of meteorology. His first
  book review is on The Invention of Clouds, by Richard Hamblyn. Luke Howard
  created our current system of cloud naming in 1802. Geoff's challenge to illustrate
  the importance of Howard's system was for a student to name a cumulus cloud
  without using the word &#8220;cumulus.&#8221; Geoff gave the book four out
  of five, and the book is available on Amazon.com for just over $11.</p>
<p>AMS Annual Meeting &#8211; This year's meeting is in Atlanta from January
  28-February 2. Last year we had eight students attend. One option for lowering
  the cost of being a student helper at the meeting. We will discuss this more
  in the coming months.</p>
<p>Fundraising &#8211; If you have any fundraising ideas or would like to take
  over fundraising, please let an officer know.</p>
<p>Central Iowa National Weather Association &#8211; The local NWA chapter includes
  students, NWS employees, broadcasters, and weather enthusiasts. The group puts
  on on an annual conference each spring (March 23-25, 2006). The first meeting
  is on September 13 at 6:00 p.m. at Godfather's in Ankeny. We will have food/social
  time at 5:30 p.m. Departure time will be made available later for those who
  are interested in carpooling.</p>
<p>Apparel &#8211; Our past apparel included T-shirts, long-sleeved shirts, and
  hooded sweatshirts. Around the end of September, we will have order forms for
  apparel. If you have design ideas, let a cabinet member know.</p>
<p>WISE Talks &#8211; If you'd be interested in helping with the Women in Science
  and Engineering program, which is geared toward promoting younger girls to
  explore the idea of majoring in science- or engineering-related fields in the
  future, contact Elise.</p>
<p>ClubFest &#8211; Wednesday September 14, 11 a.m.-4 p.m. We will have a booth
  about AMS. If you want to help, see Elise ASAP.</p>
<p>Departmental Picnic &#8211; The picnic is this Thursday 5 &#8211; 10 p.m.
  with food at 6 at Inis Grove Park. Meet at Agronomy at 5 p.m. if you'd like
  a ride. Emails will be sent out with more information.</p>
<p>National Weather Center Research Experience for Undergraduates Presentation &#8211; Elise
  was in Norman, OK this summer for the NWC REU. If you'd like more information
  on the program, visit www.caps.ou.edu/reu. To learn more about Elise's experience,
  you can view her PowerPoint from the ISU AMS website at www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams.</p>
<p>NCWFC Meeting &#8211; Janet is looking for a new manager for our NCWFC group.
  Let her know if you're interested. The contest runs from September 12, 2005 &#8211; April
  10, 2006. Forecasts include high/low temps and precip amounts every Monday
  through Thursday. Each city lasts two weeks; you only need to participate in
  8 of the 13 cities. There is a $4.00 entry fee &#8211; you can pay this in
  your dues. If you are disqualified, you do not get a refund. Rules and procedures
  are on the NCWFC website at http://www.ems.psu.edu/NFC/. The ISU Forecast Page
  is www.meteor.iastate.edu/~miraje/NCWFC/ and if you have a question, email
  Janet.</p>
<p>Other Important Info &#8211; If you haven't paid dues by the second meeting,
  you will be taken off the contact list.</p>
<p><br>
  ** Special note: Jeremy Grams (jgrams@iastate.edu) will have a special presentation
    on Thursday, September 8 at 7:00 p.m. He will be going over careers in the
    NWS for anybody who is interested. He will also be doing a presentation with
    information about the local forecasting contest.</p>
