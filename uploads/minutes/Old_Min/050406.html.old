<b>2005-2006 Officer Elections</b><br>
The following have been elected as our officers for next year:<ul>
<li><b>President:</b> Elise Johnson</li>
<li><b>Vice President:</b> Janet Schenck</li>
<li><b>Treasurer:</b> Heather Moser</li>
<li><b>Secretary:</b> Justin Gehrts</li>
<li><b>Historian:</b> Geoff Grochocinski</li>
<li><b>Social Chair:</b> Liz White</li>
<li><b>Webmaster:</b> Scott Lincoln</li></ul>

<b>Forecast Contest Updates</b><br>
<ul><li>AMS-There is no news to report. "It's still going." (Heather Moser)</li>
 <li>National-We are finally on our last city!  The summary of scores from Lander, WY
 will be sent out by Janet Schenck soon.  Good job this year!  Also, if you are   
 interested in being the local manager for our group, think about it over the
 summer and we will discuss this at a AMS meeting next school year.</li>
</ul><br><br>

<b>Treasurer Update</b><br>
We have $703 and some change in our account, but that amount will more than likely be
dropping once we get numbers from those who attended the luncheon at the Severe Storms &
Doppler Radar Conference.  We are estimating we will end up with around $600 in our account.
<br><br>

<b>Apparel Update</b><br>
Everything is in and went well.</li><br><br>

<b>2005 Spring Break Trip Presentation</b><br>
Liz White gave the spring break trip presentation.  This presentation will be posted on the
web site soon.  Liz also asked for $200 to reimburse the amount paid for car rental and gas. 
The motion was passed.<br><br>

<b>Severe Weather Awareness Elementary School Talks Update</b><br>
These talks will be presented throughout the month of April.  A list of those interested was
passed around.  This was the same list that was passed around at the last meeting.  If you
would like to help, please email Adam Kuban (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

an email from Elise in case it does rain.</li>

<b>SSDRC Refunds</b><br>
We are still waiting for the LAS council to meet to decide how much those who attended the
conference will get.  We'll tell you soon as we know how much money you will be reimbursed. 
The current reimbursement is $8, but will probably go up.  If you want to be reimbursed, make
sure to get your receipt to Brian.  If you need a receipt, email Elise Johnson
(<script language="JavaScript"><!--

var sb_url = "mailto:" + sb_recipient

hotel receipt in order to get it.  If you were in charge of paying for the hotel room, Please
