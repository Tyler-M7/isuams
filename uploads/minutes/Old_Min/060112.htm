          Society*
          <p>*http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams*</p>
          <p>/Minutes for January 12, 2006/</p>
          <p><br>
            *</p>
          <p> *National AMS Membership*</p>
          <p>* *Renew your National AMS membership if you haven't already &#8211; 
            or if you haven't yet, join! The website is www.ametsoc.org.</p>
          <p><br>
            *</p>
          <p> *Cy's Eyes*</p>
          <p>* -*From 6-9 p.m. this Friday night, there is an ISUtv-related gathering 
            at the Communications Building. It is a pop culture Trivial Pursuit 
            event with free food and open house.</p>
          <p>-Cy's Eyes is a great opportunity to practice the art of broadcast 
            meteorology. Or, if you don't want to be in television, you can still 
            work behind the scenes in the control room or operating a camera. 
            It's on ISUtv Channel 18 on Mondays and Wednesdays from 6:30-6:50 
            p.m. If you want to join, be at the Communications Building at 6:00 
            p.m. on those days. It's loads of fun and not too hard at all (plus 
            it looks good on a resume, of course)! Email Janet /(thatsme [at] 
            iastate [dot] edu)/ or Matt Taller /(mteller [at] iastate [dot] edu)/ 
            for more information.</p>
          <p>-We will have a practice show this coming Wednesday.</p>
          <p>-If you want to learn how to use the Genesis machine, get ahold of 
            Scott /(slincoln [at] iastate [dot] edu)/, Kaj /(kjomara [at] iastate 
            [dot] edu)/, or Chris /(biff016 [at] iastate [dot] edu)/.</p>
          <p><br>
            *</p>
          <p> *NCWFC*</p>
          <p>* *-Congrats to those who placed well in recent rounds, as well as 
            those who won out of the Iowa State participants.</p>
          <p>-Remember to forecast by 6 p.m.!</p>
          <p>-If you haven't paid Janet yet for NCWFC costs ($4), pay her!!! She 
            cannot be reimbursed until we have all the participants paid up! If 
            you do not pay her by next meeting, you will be called out!!!</p>
          <p><br>
            *</p>
          <p> *Social Chair*</p>
          <p>* -*Wednesday and Thursday are good days for snow tubing/skiing at 
            Seven Oaks in terms of low rates for college students. Watch your 
            emails once (if?) it gets cold again, because this event will be on 
            short notice.</p>
          <p>-We may do an end-of-year faculty-student picnic. Information/discussion 
            will be coming in the future.</p>
          <p>-Intramurals are winding down, but team bowling and softball are 
            coming up. Again, watch your emails.</p>
          <p><br>
            *</p>
          <p> *Academic Chair*</p>
          <p>-Let Chris /(biff016 [at] iastate [dot] edu)/ know your class schedules 
            so he can set up group study sessions.</p>
          <p>-If you'd like to be a session leader for a class, please email Chris. 
            He is also retiring from helping with Phys 221 study groups, so if 
            you're interested, let him know.</p>
          <p>-Please help out your fellow classmates by offering to lead a session!</p>
          <p><br>
            *</p>
          <p> *Historian*</p>
          <p>-A book review is in the works.</p>
          <p>-Geoff would like to put together an ISU Meteorology board game. 
            If you have any ideas (such as &#8220;inside jokes&#8221; in the department), 
            let him know/ (grgforce [at] iastate [dot] edu)/! He'd love to hear 
            your ideas.</p>
          <p>-Also, send him any AMS-related pictures you may have.</p>

            *</p>
          <p> *Workout Group*</p>
          <p>Since we're all busy/lazy college students, the idea has been formed 
            to start an AMS Workout Group. If you didn't sign up tonight, email 
            Janet or Geoff, including your interest (running, lifting weights, 
            etc.). Expect more information soon!</p>
          <p><br>
            *</p>
