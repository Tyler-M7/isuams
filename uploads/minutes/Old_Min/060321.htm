              <div>Dave Flory, Adam Clark, Brian Viner, and Jon Hobbs participated 
                in the grad panel for questions regarding graduate school. The 
                following are the major points that were discussed. </div>

                <div>Grad schools that are considered notable for meteorology 
                  include Penn State, OU, MIT, Texas Tech, and Texas A&amp;M (among 
                  others). </div>

                <div>Most people in meteorology generally do not have to pay for 
                  grad school anymore &#8211; students acquire a position that 
                  allows for a small income. Student loans are basically a nonissue.</div>

                <div>If you plan on attending grad school, it is a good idea to 
                  be making plans early in your senior year. However, you should 
                  start thinking about it early on in your bachelor's degree career.</div>

                <div>Schedule and take the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) &#8211; 
                  even if it's not required for a school you're applying to. You 
                  can take it multiple times, but it does have a cost (about $120). 
                  Iowa State does have GRE tests here. You should also do a lot 
                  of studying for the GRE.</div>

              <div> 
                <div>GPA is an important factor in the selection process for grad 
                  schools. Most require a 3.0 to apply. However, it is not the 
                  end-all, be-all decision. High GPAs are weighted higher in &#8220;elite&#8221; 
                  grad schools.</div>

              <div> 
                <div> There is a fee to apply to grad school (generally around 
                  $50), but one of the ideas of grad school is that you will recoup 
                  the financial obligations.</div>

                <div>If a certain topic wasn't addressed very in-depth in undergraduate 
                  studies, it does not necessarily play a large role in the graduate 
                  student selection process. For example, Iowa State does not 
                  have a large focus on tropical weather; however, if a student 
                  wanted to do graduate work on tropical systems, it is still 
                  entirely possible to go that route. Having a good command of 
                  a range of topics is important &#8211; math, physics, and so 
                  on.</div>

          <p>Campbell research-grade weather station<br>
            The Soil Tilth lab would like to mount a weather station on the roof 
            of Agronomy. Dave Flory wants the chapter to consider helping cover 
            the cost of a mount for it, which would be around $200.<br>
            This station would report data every minute; the other station would 
            remain &#8211; or get moved to a different location.<br>
            Heather reported that our AMS account is sufficient enough to help 
            out with this project.<br>
            An exact figure will be available after a proposal is submitted to 
            Facilities Planning and Management; they have to be the ones to drill 
            the holes to anchor the station.<br>
            Motion by Scott Lincoln to cap the limit donated to mount the station 
            at $250; seconded by Karen Tarara. Motion carried.</p>
          <p>General announcements<br>
            The forums are back online. Please use your first and last name when 
            registering. Scott has to approve each account. Scott added class 
            help forums &#8211; you can use these for general topics in your classes, 
            not necessarily for specific problems. They will be read by your fellow 
            students and your instructors. There is a link to the forums on the 
            ISU AMS website.<br>
            Chapter logo contest &#8211; our chapter does not have a logo. If 
            anybody has an idea for a logo and would like to make one, please 
            send it to Elise (elisevj [at] iastate [dot] edu) and Scott (slincoln 
            [at] iastate [dot] edu). A winner will be voted for at the next meeting; 
            that person will receive a free ISU AMS t-shirt.</p>
          <p>Cy&#8217;s Eyes<br>
            We only need a host for Wednesday's show. If you're on the fence about 
            helping with the show, this is a great chance to get your feet wet. 
            Sign up on the ISU AMS forums.</p>
          <p>NCWFC<br>
            Our team didn't do so well in Pensacola, FL -- 19th place.<br>
            Remember to keep forecasting &#8211; forecasts are due by 6 p.m., 
            but for the last period, forecasts are due by 7 p.m. (due to DST).<br>
            There is a forecast discussion on the ISU AMS forum.</p>
          <p>KaleidoQuiz<br>
            We placed either last or second to last. Our team was very small, 
            but we didn't drop to last place until the team disbanded.<br>
            Jason Patton will be leading the ISU AMS team next year.</p>
          <p>Minnesota trip<br>
            If you're interested in the trip to Minnesota (Friday, March 31st 
            to Sunday, April 2nd), please talk to Janet (thatsme [at] iastate 
            [dot] edu) by tonight.<br>
            We will be staying at Janet's house, with food on Saturday courtesy 
            Janet's mom.<br>
            A tour is set up at Northwest Airlines, the National River Forecast 
            Center, and Science Museum of Minnesota. If there's time, we may stop 
            by the Mall of America.<br>
            The cost will be around $25-$30 to cover gas and museum admission, 
            plus food.</p>
          <p>Intramurals<br>
            Softball is March 26th at 2:30 p.m. on Field 30 and April 2nd, 3:30 
            p.m. on Field 30<br>
            Broomball applications close tomorrow. Talk to Colin if you want to 
            play.<br>
            More activities are coming for the spring; Colin will send notices 
            for those intramurals.</p>
          <p><br>
            AMS Picnic<br>
            April 23rd at Brookside Park from 5 to 7 p.m.</p>
          <p>Historian<br>
            Geoff would like the finish the ISU Meteorology board game.</p>
          <p>VEISHEA<br>
            Cy's Big Top at VEISHEA is Saturday, April 22nd.<br>
            We need people to help run the booth at Cy's Big Top. If you would 
            like to help &#8211; of if you have any ideas for kids' games &#8211; 
            email Justin (jgehrts [at] iastate [dot] edu).</p>
          <p>Safety Signs Around Campus<br>
            There are severe weather safety shelter signs across campus. However, 
            some of them seem to be in &#8220;bad&#8221; locations. We'd like 
            to work with Facilities Planning and Management to identify these 
            areas and alter current shelter locations.<br>
            If you'd like to help out, email Scott.</p>
          <p>Science Nights<br>
            Two Science Nights on Thursday, April 6th. One will have the tornado 
            simulator.<br>
            We need help with setup and manning the rooms. Email Elise if you 
            can help out.</p>
          <p>Severe Weather Safety Poster Contest and Grocery Bags<br>
            A few schools responded wanting to participate in the poster contest. 
            We'll probably be judging the entries during the Minnesota trip.<br>
            The grocery bag project fell through for the spring. We sent a proposal 
            to Hy-Vee, but they need a six-month period beforehand. We will still 
            try to see if Dahl's and Fareway would be interested. We are thinking 
            about submitting a Winter Weather Safety design to Hy-Vee. We will 
            submit our Severe Weather Safety design next year as well.</p>
          <p>PWSE &#8211; &#8220;The Road Less Traveled&#8221; Weather Explorations
