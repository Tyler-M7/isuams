the new president of Central Iowa National Weather
Association, discussed the upcoming Severe Storms
Conference in 2004.  It will occur March 25-27, 2004
in Des Moines and cost $75 for students.  Rooms
average around $90 a night.  At least one meal as well
as a free gift will be covered in the $75 dollar fee. 
Kevin is also attempting to obtain reimbursement for
the upcoming conference, so a sign up sheet was passed
around for those interested in attending.  Contact
Kevin to get your name on this list.  For more
information on the 2004 NWA Severe Storms Conference

Our ISU AMS chapter received the Local Chapter Holl
Roll for the 3rd consecutive year.  This award is
given by the National American Meteorological Society.<BR><BR>

There are still a few AMS/ISU Meteorology t-shirts and
sweatshirts available in select sizes from last year. 
New ones will be ordered/designed if there is enough
interest, as well as polo shirts.  The t-shirts and
sweatshirts are either grey/red or navy/gold.  The
polo shirts last year had a Cyclone/AMS logo on them
and were available in blue or red.  Contact Jon if you
have design/logo ideas or if you are interested in
getting a t-shirt (either last year's or this year's).

A sign up sheet for a Spring Break trip was passed

have suggestions or would like to be added to the
'interested' list, contact Kevin. There will be an
informational meeting for those interested on
Thursday, November 13, at 7pm in Agronomy 3128.<BR><BR>

Jon discussed fundraising issues.  An opportunity is
being arranged with Jolesh Photography in Des Moiens
to paste photo proofs onto letters for mailings.  We
have done this in the past.  Contact Jon with any
other fundraising ideas.<BR><BR>
