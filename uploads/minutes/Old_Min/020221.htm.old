We had ice cream and storm chase video shown by Kevin and Justin at the end
<br>
of the meeting.</p>
<p>The Cy's Eyes webpage has been moved to a link on the chapter's web <br>
site because it's getting a little tiring to continually update it. Crew 
listing's for each show will no longer be updated. Jeremy will continue to email 
on-air talent about what to submit for graphics.</p>
<p>We can apply for funding from LAS for the Severe Storms conference fee of 
$75.&nbsp; If you are planning on going (apply as soon as possible) and weren't 
at the meeting to sign up, let Jeremy know ASAP by next Thursday. The conference 
is March 21-23 at the Embassy Suites in Des Moines. If you aren't going to the 
whole conference, there are events during the conference that are open to the 
public. Ask Penny for details.</p>
<p>Sawyer Elementary School is having a local science night. It will be on 
Thursday, April 4th from 7-8:30 pm. We would present to the little kids about 
weather. Last year, we showed them the tornado machine and videos. We need a 
truck/van to haul the tornado machine to the school. If you have a truck/van and 
would be willing to haul/or let us borrow it, let Jeremy know ASAP.</p>
<p>Severe weather talks at schools are upcoming (Severe Storms Awareness week / 
March 25-29). We went to several different elementary schools last year during 
the Severe Storms Awareness week. Jeremy will get emails to the area school 
principals soon. If interested in helping out and you weren't at the meeting, 
then let Jeremy know.</p>
<p>Veishea will be here on Saturday, April 20th. Jon Hobbs will go to the 
Buliders meeting at 117 Mackay Hall next Tuesday or Wednesday. Be thinking about 
some activities for our Veishea display at the next meeting.</p>
<p>National Forecasting Contest all-time statistics for ISU are now available 
online at the forecast contest page at
<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/mn2/weather/ncwfc.html">
http://www.angelfire.com/mn2/weather/ncwfc.html</a>. You can see any score from 
any forecasting participant from here over the past three years. We will not be 
forecasting again till after spring break. Jeremy will send out an email survey 
soon about how you forecast and ways to improve forecasting in the future.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to nominate one person from the group to receive a 
Campus Leadership Award from the university. The rest of the group didn't really 
care to much for the Parliament, so none of us got nominated.</p>
<p>Severe Weather night on Thursday, April 11th at 7:00 pm. It will be held in 
2050 Agronomy. We're calling it advanced spotter storm training. It is a joint 
venture between NWS forecaster Andy Kula, Dr. Gallus, and us. We will talk about 
promotion of the event at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Due to the Severe weather night, we have decided to push going to the NWS and 
TV station back towards later in April.</p>
<p>We have an opportunity to go see an exhibit about the climate of Minnesota at 
the History Museum in Minneapolis. We would possibly stop at the Tourist 
Trap...I mean, Mall of America during a Saturday trip. The exhibit will be 
around for five years, so no rush is necessary.</p>
<p>We've sent around a sign-up for meteorology t-shirts and sweatshirts, now 
posted on the classroom door. If you want to design a logo, you will have to get 
it done and in to Jenny by next week.</p>
<p>The Spring Break trip planning is coming along. Hotel is arranged ($1200 for 
everyone). Everybody going may need to fork out an extra $50 to pay for 
hotels/tours if we don't receive an NWA donation. A trip-only meeting is 
tentatively scheduled for March 7th at 6:30 in the classroom.</p>
<p>Next meeting will be Thursday, March 28th in the good old confines of 3128. 
We will have nominations for next year's officers at that meeting.</p>
<p>Hesse designed a funny shirt. Hopefully it looks good because people want 
one. Cost should be around $15. Sign up with Hesse if you want one.</p>
<p>Upcoming Intermural events include: Co-rec broomball and indoor soccer. 
Basketball has their first tournament game on Monday night. Bowling results 
should be known by the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>Speaking of basketball, it has become a fairly weekly ritual that AMS people 
go<br>
to the Rec to play on Thursdays. We usually meet up around 9:30.</p>
<p>That is all. So long, farewell, auf weiderzien, see ya.</p>
<p>Jonathan</p>
