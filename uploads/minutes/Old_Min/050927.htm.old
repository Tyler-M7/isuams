Iowa State University Student Chapter of the American Meteorological Society<br>
September 27, 2005
<p>Guest Speaker &#8211; Dr. Dave Schultz from NSSL was our guest speaker tonight.
  He got his PhD from State University in Albany, NY and is a research meteorologist
  at National Severe Storms Laboratory with CIMMS. He is the editor of Monthly
  Weather Review. If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Schultz, you can visit
  his website at www.cimms.ou.edu/~schultz. Look for his Powerpoint presentation
  on the ISU AMS website soon.</p>
<p>Tree Donation for Agronomy Courtyard &#8211; Most of the trees in the Agronomy
  Courtyard were removed after being damaged by the tornado. Janet looked into
  the purchasing of trees. The tree and installation would cost $250-$300. A
  fund may be set up by the University to cover the cost of replacing approximately
  fifty trees across campus; however, we are not able to donate only a part of
  the cost of a tree. After a vote, the chapter opted to not donate money toward
  the purchase of a new tree.</p>
<p>Treasury Update &#8211; The account still stands at $1042.73. Heather will
  be depositing dues soon.</p>
<p>National Weather Service Visit &#8211; Heather passed around a sign-up sheet
  for those interested in visiting the NWS in Johnston. It will likely be sometime
  in October or early November.</p>
<p>Future Guest Speakers &#8211; Jon Davies will be speaking on October 18. The
  Cabinet discussed helping to pay for the expense of bringing in Jon, which
  would be $150-$200. Liz moved to give up to $200 to Dr. Gallus for bringing
  in Jon; Janet seconded. Motion passed.</p>
<p>Our next speaker is Janet's father, who is a flight dispatcher. He will be
  talking about meteorology opportunities in the airlines.</p>
<p>Sophomore Chair &#8211; The duties of the sophomore chair include being the
  social chair's right-hand man (or woman, as the case may be) and acting as
  the liaison between upper- and lower-classmen. Colin Oraskovich and Ashley
  Carter both vied for the position; the freshmen and sophomores in attendance
  voted for Colin. He will now be a Cabinet member. Underclassmen can email him
  at orasky@iastate.edu.</p>
<p>Social Chair Update &#8211; Good job to the flag football teams. Tournament
  postings will be emailed to participants. The broomball schedule is out; Liz
  will also be letting those involved know the details. Quite a few intramurals
  are currently open; however, they're mostly individual sports. Go to recservices.iastate.edu
  or talk to Liz for more information.</p>
<p> Remember, meteorology basketball is Wednesday nights at 9 p.m. at Lied Rec.</p>
<p>Geoff's Book Review &#8211; Geoff reviewed White Hurricane. This book discussed
  a 1913 gale on the Great Lakes. He admitted that he did not read all of the
  book because he was so disappointed in its delivery; he pointed out, however,
  that the book goes into interesting detail about the history of the Weather
  Bureau at the time and how they had to respond to Great Lakes storms. Geoff's
  major complaint was that the book described each affected ship in detail in
  chronological order, which made it difficult to follow. Geoff's Verdict: Decent,
  PEI 2.</p>
<p><br>
  Academic Chair Update &#8211; Chris' website listing who is in what classes
  is now online: http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/~biff016/AMS/list.html. If you
  want to be added to a class, email him. He still needs leaders for classes;
  if you can help, let Chris know.</p>
<p>AMS Annual Meeting &#8211; January 28 - February 2, 2006. The student assistanceship
  covers your expenses except for travel. If you are awarded, you help at the
  conference. Seniors also have travel grants available. Deadline is October
  21! College of LAS also is offering money for conference travel. If you're
  interested in attending the AMS Annual Meeting, contact Elise!</p>
<p>Forecasting Contests Update &#8211; No news for the Local Forecast Contest.
  You can still sign up on the LFC contest page if you're interested (http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/~miraje/AFC).
  In the National Contest, ISU placed 8th out of 29 schools, and our top five
  forecasters also placed 8th. The top people in each category at ISU were Dr.
  Gallus at 2nd (Group 1); Jon Hobbs at about 57th (2); Chris Maiers, Janet Schenck,
  Karen Tarara, and Matt Walter at about 35th-38th (3); and Jason Patton at about
  22nd (4). Dr. Gallus won Janet's &#8220;Close But No Cigar&#8221; and &#8220;ISU
  Top-Placer&#8221; Awards for getting 2nd place in his category. Jayson Prentice
  will be our Manager beginning next year.</p>
<p>Cy's Eyes Update &#8211; A new Cy's Eyes email list is being created. If you
  want to be on the list and you haven't put your name on it yet, let Janet know.
  We also plan to expand the show to 30 minutes; if you have any ideas for packages,
  let Janet or Matt Teller (mteller@iastate.edu) know.</p>
<p>Apparel &#8211; Order forms were emailed out. Print off a copy and give it
  to Liz, Elise, or put it in the AMS Mailbox in the office (Room 3010) by Monday,
  October 3! Include a check (made out to ISU AMS) or money when you turn it
  in. We will also be doing a storm chasing shirt not affiliated with the AMS
  apparel. If you're interested, see Elise or Liz. Shirts should cost about $10-$12.</p>
<p>WISE Science Exploration Talk &#8211; If you'd like to help out with this
  event, let Elise know. It is 3:30 - 6:00 p.m. on Thursday, November 3.</p>
<p>Road Less Traveled &#8211; Talk to Elise or Liz if you'd like to help with
  this event that is similar to school talks. The dates are October 13, 20, and
  27 at the Memorial Union from 1-2 p.m.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next meeting is Monday, October 31 at 7:00 p.m. We will have a costume contest.</p>
