We have money: $840.03<br>
<br>
Send Penny an email if you want to know how much you've earned from fundraising.<br>
<br>
Kevin wins the first 1&quot; snow contest by default. This winter has not been good 
for snow. No 1&quot; snow yet.<br>
<br>
We are doing well in the national forecast contest. Jeremy leads the 
junior/senior division and Stephen leads the freshman/sophomore division. Just 
keep remembering to send in your forecasts because misses hurt the team overall. 
Next city is Caribou, Maine.<br>
<br>
Cy's Eyes will hopefully start on Tuesday. ITC sucks (except for Justin). The 
show will be from 6-6:15 this semester, so we will try to get the studio by 
5:30.<br>
<br>
Schedule for intramural basketball are out. First game is next Thursday night,<br>
7:00 pm, State Gym, Court 7. The schedule will be posted outside of 3128 on the 
AMS board. Meteorology basketball nights at the Rec will generally be held on 
Tuesday and Thursday Nights. Emails will be sent out about it when they are 
planned.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We are going to see the women's basketball team play Colorado. That game is 
Saturday, February 9 at 2:00 pm. Email Kevin (ksully01@iastate.edu) if you would 
like to go or if you have an all-sports ticket that you could let someone 
borrow.<br>
<br>
The Severe Storms Conference will be Thursday, March 21 through Saturday, March 
23 at the Embassy Suites in Des Moines. We will try to get some money from the 
LAS council to help pay for the cost of it.&nbsp; <br>
$75 for students (if you sign up by March 1st)<br>
$105 for hotel room<br>
<br>
Severe weather safety school talks are a possibility again this year. We started 
them last year and had a ball. This year, we're planning to do this March 25-29 
during Severe Weather Awareness Week.<br>
<br>
Justin is starting to try to maybe think about tweaking the Tornado Machine. We 
will try to get it together for the annual VEISHEA showing in April.<br>
<br>
We had a barbecue last year. We will do it again later in the spring.<br>
<br>
We're thinking about buying T-shirts again this year. Several suggestions have 
been brought up. It looks like we'll order both T-shirts and sweatshirts and 
sort out the bloody mess later. Jenny will lead this operation.<br>
<br>
We're going to go down to the NWS down in Johnston (suburb of Des Moines) 
sometime in March or April (preferably after the NWA conference). Spotter 
training and a TV station tour (probably channel 5 with chief meteorologist Brad 
Edwards) will be included in the whole tour. Justin is in the process of getting 
everything settled.<br>
<br>
The amendment to pay for the 2nd calendar year of the president's national AMS 
dues passed 34 to 1. An amendment to the constitution involving&nbsp; outsiders 
(non-students) to participate in the chapter activities and meetings whom has 
paid their dues for the term (however, those persons do not get to vote on 
issues involving the chapter). Only 22 of 43 voting members were at the meeting. 
So those who were not there, will get to vote by email in one week.<br>
<br>
We had no objections to moving the meeting times up to 6:30 pm on Thursday 
nights. Our next meeting is scheduled for Thursday, February 21. It will be an 
ice cream/cornbread (ask Justin) social event.<br>
<br>
Intramurals coming up:<br>
Co-rec Broomball<br>
Team Bowling<br>
Indoor Soccer<br>
5-player Basketball<br>
Co-rec Water Volleyball<br>
Co-rec 6-player Volleyball<br>
Email Kevin if you are interested in participating in any of these things.<br>
<br>
Jordan, Iowa F5 tornado event will take a while to get together. If it's pulled 
off, it will be in April. Adam Frederick may be a possible speaker too.<br>
<br>
We will show off pictures of storm chases from last year at the next meeting. 
Stephen, Kevin, and Justin will hopefully have something to show off. If you 
have anything you would like to show, storm chasing or some other meteorological 
thing you are proud of, send Jeremy an email.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
13 people are going on the spring break trip to Colorado. More information will 
be sent directly to those who are going.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Looking forward to many wonderful, insanely exciting things. If you have 
questions, call the secretary. We'll do lunch. Ciao.<br>
<br>
Jonathan Lowe<br>
