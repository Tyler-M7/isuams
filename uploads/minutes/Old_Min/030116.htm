<p>Meeting Minutes</p></b>
<p>38 members were in attendance</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Shirts:&nbsp; If you ordered shirts and 
haven't picked them up yet, please do so ASAP.&nbsp; 
They're in Jenny's office - right next to the classroom.</p>
<p>Also, we're reordering sweatshirts, and 
ordering polo shirts.&nbsp; If you want either, let Jenny know.&nbsp; According to 
Brandon, the polo shirts "will be cool".</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Money:&nbsp; After taking out what people 
have for fundraising money, we have about $800 in our account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Brochures:&nbsp; Brandon has been working 
on an AMS brochure, and has been to one place so far to check on prices.&nbsp; They 
will be approximately $1 per brochure.&nbsp; A vote was held on ordering 200 
brochures.&nbsp; The vote passed with 27 yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Stickers:&nbsp; It was brought up that we 
could order stickers to give to kids at our school talks and other events.&nbsp; We 
can order 500 stickers for $100, we decided to order 
250 stickers for $50.&nbsp; This was voted on and passed.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;-Banner:&nbsp; Jenny has been working on 
pricing a banner for the group to display at Veisha, science fairs, and other 
events we attend.&nbsp; It will cost approximately $100.&nbsp; This was also voted on and 
passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Minnesota trip:&nbsp; We're planning a trip 
to Minneapolis for January 25<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; We will go to the history museum 
and science center.&nbsp; We'll leave around 8 or 9 am, and get back late that 
night.&nbsp; If you are interested in going, email Brandon (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

// --></script>) 
ASAP.&nbsp; The total cost for the science center won't be more than $14 per person.&nbsp; 
You will also need money for food, and any shopping you want to do.&nbsp; If you can 
drive, let Brandon know that in the email too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Science Fair:&nbsp; We have been invited to 
a science fair at Roosevelt Elementary school on February 20<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; We 
will need a few people to attend this, and need to get the tornado machine 
there.&nbsp; If you are interested, let Brandon know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-School Talk:&nbsp; We have also been asked 
to do a school talk on Friday February 21<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp; They would like us to 
talk from 11:20 to 12:20, and then from 12:20 to 1:20.&nbsp; Again, email Brandon if 
you are interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Storm Spotter Training:&nbsp; We have lined 
up a day to do advanced storm spotter training again.&nbsp; It will be held March 11<sup>th</sup> 
in room 2050 Agronomy Hall, at 7:00 pm.&nbsp; Andy Kula and Jeff Johnson from the 
National Weather Service will be leading the training.&nbsp; This would be a great 
thing to attend if you are interested in chasing, or just interested in severe 
weather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Severe Storms Conference:&nbsp; Will be 
held March 27-29.&nbsp; Registration for the conference is $75, but we can usually 
get money from LAS to help pay for this.&nbsp; Chase will contact them about getting 
something.&nbsp; Information about the conference is available online at
<a href="http://www.iowa-nwa.com/">
www.iowa-nwa.com</a>, and you can also register for the conference there.&nbsp; Many 
students from ISU will be attending, and we will have a few hotel rooms that can 
fit 6 or more people in…to cut down the cost.&nbsp; If you have questions about it, 
contact Penny (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

when it gets closer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-NWS/TV trip:&nbsp; Jeremy has talked with 
the NWS about a day, and they said any day is fine.&nbsp; Brandon will contact Ed 
Wilson at WHO and try to set up a Wednesday in 
February to go to Des Moines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Intramurals:&nbsp; Brian was not being very 
social, but did say we have a mens basketball team signed up.&nbsp; There were not 
enough women interested.&nbsp; Other intramural information will be emailed to you as 
they come up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Forecast Contest:&nbsp; The next city will 
be Berlin Germany, if you do not want to participate, let Jeremy know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Cy
Eyes:&nbsp; You can still be a part of cys eyes this semester even if your schedule 
did not allow it last year.&nbsp; We have changed the time to Tuesdays and Thursdays, 
at 6:45…unless something else comes up.&nbsp; We hope to have our first show of the 
semester news Thursday the 23<sup>rd</sup>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Spring Break:&nbsp; There doesn't seem to 
be a lot of interest in going to Florida.&nbsp; If you are 
interested in going there, or anywhere else, email Jeremiah (<script language="JavaScript"><!--

We have been to Oklahoma and Colorado the past two years, and have learned a lot 
and had a lot of fun both years.&nbsp; It is a great opportunity to get somewhere out 
of the area for spring break.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Brandon gave a presentation on a 
seminar he attended over the summer.&nbsp; It was called the NCAR Undergraduate 
Leadership Workshop, attended by 17 students from around the country.&nbsp; The 
presentation will be up on the AMS website if you want to look at it.&nbsp; If you 
have any questions about it, email Brandon…once
