AMS Meeting Minutes by Jonathan Lowe (edited by Jeremy) - 10/18/01</P>
<P>The football tailgate will be this Saturday at 11 AM in Lot S5 at Jack Trice
Stadium. The football game will start at 1 (vs. Oklahoma State).
Those dues-paid members get to eat without the worry of shelling out paper
currency to the overlords. Sign-up
with Kevin (<A HREF="mailto:ksully01@iastate.edu">ksully01@iastate.edu</A>) by
email if you haven't signed up yet. Come out and have fun!</P>
<P>Jenny will be buying items at Target to spoof up the bulletin board.&nbsp;
(Approved by the chapter.)</P>
<P>Dr. Gallus is looking for juniors/seniors/grad students to help perspective
students look at the program. It would be a 30-40 minute talk
about the program (including answering
questions). The professors will help with statistics about what the students
will probably ask. Email Jeremy if interested.</P>
<P>The Halloween Party is scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 31 (Halloween night,
what a concept!). Kevin is looking for help in putting the
shindig together, talk/email Kevin. Sign-up on the AMS
bulletin board by the end of the next week. The party will
start at 7:15 in 3128.</P>
<P>Brian Viner won the bowling competition. He got a car! It's black with white
stripes.</P>
<P>The National AMS Conference is looming. It will take place the first week of
classes next semester (Spring '02) in Orlando. Student travel
grants are due to AMS by October 22nd and are only
available to senior undergrads and grad students. Student
assistants applications are available for all AMS student
members. The applications are available at the AMS website <A HREF="http://www.ametsoc.org/AMS">http://www.ametsoc.org/AMS</A></P>
<P>The Spring Break trip was proposed to be in lovely Colorado. We're planning
on possibly visiting NCAR, FSL, Mesa Lab, CU, CSU, National Parks, Air
Force Academy, Skiing, Pikes Peak, Denver, and Boulder. A committee of 3-4
people is needed to help organize the trip. Talk/email Jeremy as soon as
possible if you are interested in helping plan the trip. Informational meeting
about the trip will be held on Thursday, November 15th.</P>
<P>People said that they would prefer that fundraising at Jolesch (in Des
Moines) be on Thursday nights. There are two dates that
will work, November 1st and November 8th. 10-12 people are
needed each night. Be prepared to stay down there all
night (about 4-10). Penny will get in contact with those people that
sign up. It's fun...you get to know everyone better.</P>
<P>The next broomball game is at 1:55 AM, Thursday Night October 25th (or Friday Morning, October 26th if you prefer) at the new Ames/ISU
Ice Arena. Guys, show up to play. Ladies and guys who
don't want to play, come out to root the guys on. We need
fans to go &quot;WHOA HESSE&quot;.</P>
<P>Dr. Gallus graciously presented moving video on the Johnstown Flood, Waterloo
tornado, and Oklahoma City tornado, to the group. We said things like
'Cool' and 'Sweet'. A big thanks to Dr. G for giving his time to bestow
on us his knowledge of killing people with weather.</P>
<P>Next meeting will be Thursday, November 29th. Happy Halloween. BOOGA</P>
<P>BOOGA!!! Happy Thanksgiving too!</P>
