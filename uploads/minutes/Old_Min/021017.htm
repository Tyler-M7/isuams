Here are the minutes from the October 17th, 2002 AMS meeting.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things at the end of the minutes that were not 
discussed at the meeting...make sure to look at them!</p>
<p>Jason Parkin from KCCI TV came and talked to the group. He talked about 
getting into a career in broadcasting. He also showed video from some storm 
chases he's been on, including May 11, 2000 Dunkerton, IA. If anyone is 
interested in interning with Jason or anyone else at KCCI, or if you have any 
questions, his email address is <script language="JavaScript"><!--

<p>National AMS -- Brandon had National AMS applications. I believe they ran 
out, so if you want more, email Brandon at <script language="JavaScript"><!--

<p>Weather Sensor -- It has been brought up that it would be nice to get the 
weather station in the map room functioning. Estimates for the cost to fix it 
are around $200. The meteorology has said they will pay half if we pay half. We 
will discuss this more and vote on it at the next meeting...after we have more 
details.</p>
<p>Trip -- We had discussed taking a trip to Minneapolis, but nothing has been 
done on it yet. Brandon will be talking with people on the trip committee to 
plan this.</p>
<p>Fundraising -- We have received the schedule of possible days from Jolesch to 
fundraise. I will be calling them Monday to try to get a couple of days. 
Wednesday and Thursday seemed to be the most popular days. I will try to get 
Wednesday November 20th and Thursday December 5th. We will leave around 4, work 
from 5 to 9, and then be back to Ames by 10ish. We need 10 people to go each 
day. It's really easy work, and is fun. I will send out an email after I get 
a hold of them to tell you what days we're doing for sure. Then you can start 
emailing me to sign up.</p>
<p>Shirts -- No one submitted a t-shirt design. Some designs were submitted for polo shirts. We decided on one at the meeting. It has a cy with a circle of words around it saying Iowa State University Chapter of the American 
Meteorological Society (I think). We have to get permission to use the cy, and 
have to check on prices. We will probably be able to get a variety of colors 
with no extra charge. Sweatshirts will be ordered next week. If you want one, 
get a hold of Jenny ASAP at <script language="JavaScript"><!--

<p>Snow Contest -- Entries are $1 each, we'll be accepting entries up through 
October 31st. Choose a day, and get a hold of Jeremiah, or another officer if you 
see them. You are trying to pick the first day (After Oct. 31st) with 1 inch of 
snow at the National Weather Service office in Johnston. Any questions, email Jeremiah.

<p>**Not discussed at meeting</p>
<p>Boy Scouts -- We need 3 or 4 people to volunteer to speak with a boy scout 
group in town on November 5th. Not sure about the time, but probably around 5 or 
6. If you are interested in doing this email Brandon ASAP at
