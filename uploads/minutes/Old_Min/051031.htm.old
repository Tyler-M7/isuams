Ghastly Minutes for October 31, 2005
<p>Secretary's note: Emails will be in a different format in the minutes from
  now on so that when they're posted on the ISU AMS website, spam crawlers won't
  pick them up. For example, somebody@iastate.edu will be in the form somebody
  [at] iastate [dot] edu.<br>
  Fighting junk email one inbox at a time, - Justin</p>
<p>Message from the National AMS &#8211;</p>
<p> Everyone should have received an email from Elise today regarding National
  AMS membership. If you're a national member, you'll have to renew your membership
  soon. If you're not a member, sign up!</p>
<p> In addition, the ISU AMS was selected for the National Honor Roll. Let's
  shoot for the Chapter of the Year! That is an award that requires dedication
  and hard work and effort.</p>
<p>Cy's Eyes Update/National Forecast Contest &#8211; </p>
<p> The Genesis is up and running. If you're on-air, make sure you sign up for
  graphics time. We're hoping to move to a 30 minute show soon. If you're not
  on the mailing list, email Janet at thatsme [at] iastate [dot] edu.</p>
<p> Janet will be emailing those of you who have yet to pay for the National
  Contest. Two people won first for the most recent contest. Jill Ihrke won the
  Alpena, MI round, both in her category and overall! Matt Walter won the Victoria,
  TX round. And remember, forecasts are now due at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Treasurer Update &#8211; </p>
<p> We have about $1708 in the account, but there will be some money taken out.
  We'll end up near $1000 when all is said and done. The expenses include tonight's
  pizza and helping bring Jon Davies in to give a talk.</p>
<p>Social Chair Update &#8211; <br>
    <br>
  Intramurals must have two more than the required number of players for a team
  from now on. Girls' flag football got 2nd place and was invited to a tournament
  in Iowa City. Check the Intramurals website or talk to Liz for intramural information,
  particularly if you'd like to play basketball.</p>
<p>Academic Chair Update &#8211; </p>
<p> Midterms are over, but keep checking the website for study times and review
  sessions. Physics 221, 222, and Stat 105 will have review sessions soon. Chris
  Maiers will have a 221 review session soon; Kaj Johnson-O'Mara will have a
  222 review session Tuesday, Nov. 1 at 7 p.m. in the classroom; Jon Hobbs will
  have a Stat 105 review session Tuesday, Nov. 8 at 7 p.m. in the classroom.
  If you need help, just ask for it! We're here to help each other.</p>
<p>Geoff's Book Review &#8211; </p>
<p> Storm Chasers is a &#8220;page-turning&#8221; book on hurricane hunting,
  particularly the history of it. It includes the story of the single hurricane
  hunting crew to go down (1955). Hurricane hunting began during WWII, but the
  planes weren't top-notch... however, a bet was made that a gentleman could
  fly one of these plants into a hurricane and back. He successfully flew through
  the eye and back to land. The military only began interested in flying into
  hurricanes after a base was struck by a typhoon. The book also goes into the
  history of hurricane naming. Geoff's Rating: PEI 4; PEI 5 for Air Force students.</p>
<p>NWA Annual Meeting Presentation &#8211; </p>
<p> Janet, Elise, and Chris went to the NWA Annual Meeting in St. Louis recently.
  They all encourage AMS members to join our local NWA chapter. The NWA is geared
  more toward operational meteorology, so those of you interested in broadcasting
  should seriously consider also becoming an NWA member and attending the National
  Conference in the future ($80 for students, plus $40 for the Broadcasting Conference).</p>
<p>AMS Annual Meeting Information &#8211; </p>
<p> Student assistantship information has been sent by the National AMS. Check
  your email inboxes if you applied! If you've signed up for the National Conference
  but can't afford to go because you didn't receive an assistantship, take your
  name off the list so we can have an accurate count of our members who will
  be attending.</p>
<p> We're discussing how to split money from the University for travel aid. We'll
  be applying for money from two University sources. The total help will probably
  be $100 maximum per person. Watch your email for more details. As the time
  approaches, we'll be figuring out airfare, general costs, and other details
  relevant to the conference.</p>
<p>Graduate Poster Session &#8211; </p>
<p> On Tuesday, November 15, the Graduate AMS Club will be holding a research
  poster session for graduate students, seniors, and other classes if they wanted
  to present a poster. The proposal is to aid in the cost of posters; a good
  poster would cost about $30; we would not cover the full cost of each one.
  About half a dozen seniors plan to present posters. Please attend and support
  the research being presented... and you'll learn a thing or two in the process.</p>
<p> Discussion included the feeling that only ISU AMS seniors should receive
  money, not nonmembers. In addition, underclassmen may not feel it's fair to
  give money. Another sentiment is that the money would be better spent on community
  outreach.</p>
<p> There was no motion to give any monetary assistance, so the proposal failed.</p>
<p>Faculty/Student Dinner &#8211; </p>
<p> This will be held Thursday, November 10 at 5:00 p.m. at Hickory Park. We
  ABSOLUTELY MUST KNOW everyone who is attending!!! Rides will be provided from
  the north parking lot at about 4:40; more details will follow.</p>
<p>Apparel &#8211;</p>
<p> If you ordered ISU AMS apparel, pick it up after the meeting. See Elise to
  arrange times to pick up your apparel.</p>
<p>WISE Science Exploration Talk &#8211; </p>
<p> This Thursday, 3:30-6:00 in Howe Hall. Talk to Elise if you'd like to help
  out, specifically if	you have a fun weather activity.</p>
<p>NWS Visit &#8211; </p>
<p> November 15 at 6:30 &#8211; contact Heather if you want to go and haven't
  signed up already. Since this is a government facility, we need a full list
  of who is attending.</p>
<p>Costume Contest &#8211; </p>
<p> 2nd place (tie): Meteorologist after hurricane (Andrew Ansorge a.k.a. Jim
  Cantore) and Jedi (Chris Davidson)<br>
  1st place: Matrix trifecta of two Agent Smiths and Trinity (Chris Maiers, Kaj
  Johnson-O'Mara, and Jesse Wartman)</p>
<p>Guest Speaker &#8211; </p>
<p> Janet's father, Pete Schenck, has worked for Northwest Airlines for 31 years.
  He has been a flight dispatcher, plane accident investigator, and fear-of-flying
  instructor.</p>
<p> Flight dispatchers determine a flight's crucial details (route, fuel load,
  etc.), provide a flight plan, and interact between the pilot, air traffic control,
  and company interests. The Aircraft Situation Display at Northwest tracks flights,
  projects tracks, and overlays 99 Doppler radar sites in a mosaic, as well as
  shows live weather reports, data, and forecasts.</p>
<p> Northwest utilizes a System Operations Control, in which nine groups are
  in the same area, including meteorologists. The meteorologists support efficiency
  and safety and provide services that are invaluable to the airline. A meteorologist
  is with a flight dispatcher to watch for changing weather conditions and assist
  in making changes to flights based on these changes.</p>
<p> The meteorologists utilize collaborative convection forecasts and radar data
  to determine flight route changes. They also use winter weather depictions
  to determine wintry weather situations, as well as tropical weather depiction
  (especially this year!) Northwest has its own clear and mountain wave turbulence
  procedures, which are used to update dispatchers and pilots. Research continues
  into analyzing turbulence that occurs near the tropopause. Turbulence data
  and plots are a big part of forecasting and research.</p>
<p> Pete foresees one centralized office of contracted meteorologists for many,
  if not all, airlines.</p>
<p>Next meeting is Wednesday, November 30 at 5:00 p.m. Note the different time!</p>
