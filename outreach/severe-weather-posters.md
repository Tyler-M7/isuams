## 2017 Severe Weather Poster Contest

Severe weather has a huge impact across the country, especially here in the Midwest. Severe weather, ranging from lightning and tornadoes to high winds and flash flooding, can damage property and crops and more importantly cause serious injuries and even death. Most recently, the EF 3 tornado that swept through New Orleans, LA, the strongest ever recorded in the city, injured 25 people and devastated homes. It is extremely important for not only adults but also children to know the dangers and risks of severe weather and know how to be prepared for such an event. For that reason the Iowa State Student Chapter of the American Meteorological Society (ISU AMS) is sponsoring a Severe Weather Awareness Poster Contest​. Below is more information on this year’s contest, including official rules, poster tips, and flyers for distribution. 

The contest is open to all elementary students in the state of Iowa, grades K-6, and will be judged on the basis of how well they can illustrate what they and their families can do to prepare for severe weather events in Iowa. Posters should convey a simple and straightforward message, with legible writing and bright/visible artwork to complement their message. The winners of both categories, grades K-3 and 4-6, as well as honorable mentions will be displayed on the ISU AMS web page and may receive recognition from local media.
