## 2016 Severe Weather Poster Contest

The summer of 2015 was devastating for the nation in terms of severe weather, with injuries and deaths from floods, tornadoes, and lightning. More recently, the extremely warm temperatures we have been experiencing here in Iowa due to the strong El Nino that is in place. It is important not only for adults, but children to know the dangers and risks during severe weather events and how they can be prepared during such an event. For this reason the Iowa State Student Chapter of the American Meteorological Society (ISU AMS) is sponsoring a Severe Weather Awareness Poster Contest. Below is more information on this yearâ€™s contest, including official rules, poster tips, and flyers for distribution.  

The contest is open to all elementary students in the state of Iowa (grades K-6), and will be judged on the basis of how well they can illustrate what they and their families can do to prepare for severe weather events in Iowa. Posters should convey a simple and straightforward message, with legible writing and bright/visible artwork to compliment their message. The winners of both categories (grades K-3 and 4-6) as well as honorable mentions will be displayed on the ISU AMS webpage and may receive recognition from local media.  

A huge thank you to the teachers and parents who supported this year's severe weather poster contest!
