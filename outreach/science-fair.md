For the last three years, ISU AMS has had the pleasure of hosting a science fair for children in 
1st grade through 5th grade. Young scientists get the chance to investigate a question
and present their findings to judges and attendees of the fair. When not presenting, science fair
participants and their families enjoy a wide variety of science and weather activities including
making anemometers, the tornado simulator, cloud pictures, and tornado in a bottle. Starting from
humble beginnings, the fair has grown over the last three years. If you have any questions feel
free to contact us at sciencefairams@gmail.com.
