For the last four years, ISU AMS has had the pleasure of hosting a science fair for children in 
1st grade through 5th grade. Young scientists get the chance to investigate a question
and present their findings to judges and attendees of the fair. When not presenting, science fair
participants and their families enjoy a wide variety of science and weather activities including
making anemometers, the tornado simulator, cloud pictures, and tornado in a bottle. Starting from
humble beginnings, the fair has grown over the last four years. If you have any questions feel
free to contact us at sciencefairams@gmail.com. To sign up for the science fair on April 27th, please submit this form: [https://tinyurl.com/yy73qtvw](https://tinyurl.com/yy73qtvw).
